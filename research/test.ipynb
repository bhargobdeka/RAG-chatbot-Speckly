There are Speckle kits, which are the base of our approach to interoperability.

Simple: if an architect/engineer/AEC professional interacts with it, it's a Speckle **product** built on top of Speckle's **developer platform**.\\n\\nThe developer platform consists of code that makes it easier for us (and you!) to build user-facing applications - either web-based or desktop-based.\\n\\nThis section is about the platform, and not about the products.

You\\'ll be ready to make the most out of what Speckle has to offer.\\n\\nYou will know how you could create your own backend to Speckle, how data flows and how you can control those flows, how data is stored, as well as how applications interact with Speckle and can use it as a data persistence framework.\\n\\nSpeckle is the open source data platform built for the AEC industry. What does this platform do? Put simply, Speckle consists of a set of infrastructural components needed to **store** and **retrieve** data.\\n\\n### [#](#data)\\n Data\\n\\nSome of these applications are authoring tools - such as Revit and Rhino - and other applications are SPA web apps, other more fully fledged backend apps - including scripts, serverless functions, etc.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/unfold.e179bf8d.png)\\n\\nThese applications, in order to talk to each other and make sense of the data they are consuming, need to speak a common language. The design and principles of this common language are centred around **composability** and **extensibility,** and **not** around **completeness**. This makes Speckle much more approachable than, for example, IFC.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\n[Here\\'s an article](/dev/base)\\n through how we implemented this approach in our .NET SDK.\\n\\n[#](#kits)\\n Kits\\n----------------\\n\\nA Speckle kit is, essentially, the definition of a common language: a schema. Moreover, a Speckle kit also contains the translation routines to and from an application\\'s native object model to the kit\\'s schema. Kits are \"hot-swappable\": Speckle comes with one by default which delivers the core of our interoperability capabilities. Nevertheless, anyone can define their own kit to serve their purpose.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/kits.e6428454.png)\\n\\nExisting authoring applications, such as Rhino, Revit, Autocad, send and receive data from and to Speckle by passing it through the conversion routines of a given kit. This is handled through **connectors.** Connectors are plugins that integrate within these host applications (e.g., the Rhino Connector) and allow end-users to select the data they want to send to Speckle, and, behind the scenes, convert it and, lastly, transport it to Speckle.\\n\\nExtra Reading\\n\\nRead more about **kits** [here](/dev/kits)\\n. If curious, you can also follow up with the discussion on [our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/introducing-kits-2-0/710)\\n.\\n\\nWe also have a guide on how to write your own **connector** - [check it out](/dev/connectors-dev.html)\\n!\\n\\nOther applications do not necessarily need to do so: they can directly use a kit\\'s schema - or simply use objects that respect the few low-level constraints that Speckle needs to serve its purpose. These aspects are described below in [Serialisation & Structure](#serialisation-structure)\\n. Next, we\\'re going to discuss how the serialisation layer interacts with the storage layer.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-storage)\\n Serialisation and Storage\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce Speckle data is translated or directly created, it needs to be serialised and, lastly, stored. In reverse, data needs to be retrieved from the storage layer and de-serialised to a memory representation that can be used by the application it was received in (either converted back to host application representations, or consumed by the business logic of the app. During the process of serialisation, Speckle also needs to decompose objects into their constituent parts; similarly, it needs to re-compose them during the de-serialisation process.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/serialisation.7d9aa653.png)\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper into Speckle\\'s decomposition and re-composition procedures, we will first take a look at how the storage layer is handled in Speckle and the flexibility it offers.\\n\\n[#](#transports)\\n Transports\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDifferent storage systems have various characteristics that make them better (or more ill) suited for different scenarios. This is why, rather than employ a unique storage system, Speckle uses an intermediary abstraction layer: transports. A transport defines the way Speckle writes to, and reads from, a given persistence layer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/transports.65882822.png)\\n\\nOne such transport is the Speckle Server Transport. Another transport is an SQLite Transport. Speckle comes with a couple of other transports too: a MongoDB transport, an In-Memory Transport, as well as a Disk Transport. Other transports, such as an S3 transport, a MySQL transport could easily be developed.\\n\\nThe Disk Transport writes and reads your Speckle data from files in a location you specify, while the SQLite Transport does the same, but backed by a SQLite database. For example, the latter is used extensively throughout our connectors as a local cache so as to reduce the dependency on a high-latency transport, namely the one for the Speckle Server.\\n\\nTransports offer developers low-level flexibility in developing, essentially, their own custom back-ends to Speckle, or pushing data to other systems that can do different things - even a whole new Speckle Server.\\n\\nMoreover, send operations are no longer restricted to one single location: Speckle allows you to send data, in parallel, to multiple transports. For example, data can be sent to two different Server Transports at the same time, one being an internal server and one being an external one - a different stakeholder involved in the process.\\n\\nAlternatively, a plugin based on Speckle could be developed that acts much more like git, writing data to a local folder that resides right next to the source file itself. This enables, in whatever configuration you see fit, a local only usage of Speckle, with pushing to remotes being a secondary, optional operation.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\nA work-in-progress guide on how to write your own transport can be found [here](transports-dev)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-structure)\\n Serialisation and Structure\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore data can be persisted to a storage system, it needs to be serialised. Serialisation is the process by which an object is converted into a state that can be stored or transmitted, and be reconstructed later from (deserialisation).\\n\\nObjects are, by their nature, structured data. The object graph and, implicitly, its structure, gives it meaning. Serialising a whole object graph in a naive way would result into a large blob which would be difficult to work with, and exclude certain workflows - such as reading just subsets of the graph, or individual objects - without deserialising the whole structure first. Storage systems, such as databases, work best with what we call \"flat\" data: individual rows, each corresponding to a given object.\\n\\nSpeckle solves this structural impedance mismatch by deconstructing an object into its individual constituent parts during the process of serialisation. These individual objects are then sent for storage to any given transports.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/deconstruction.c0422666.png)\\n\\nEach object, when serialised, gets a unique id which is generated by hashing its value. This means that all objects are immutable: if they change throughout their lifecycle, they get a new hash.\\n\\nThese object hashes are also used to assemble, for each individual object, its internal graph references. What this means, essentially, is that each Speckle object contains the information needed for reconstructing its full graph of descendants - alongside its own data.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/reconstruction.4927e890.png)\\n\\nAt the heart of `git` there are two types of objects: trees and blobs. Blobs represent the files themselves, and trees represent the file structure. **Objects in Speckle are, essentially, both a tree and a blob at the same time** - the \"blob\" being the value of the object itself, and the tree representing its object graph. While git sources its tree from the folder structure of your project, Speckle sources it from the object graph itself.\\n\\nWhen deserialising data, Speckle reconstructs it at the same time. This means that data can reside and make use of the upsides of storage systems such as relational databases, while at the same time, developers are not constrained as to how they structure it and can continue working with it freely inside their applications.\\n\\nAnother important note is that Speckle uses JSON as the native serialisation format for the object \"blobs\". JSON is a format that is widely used and has plenty of tooling in various languages, and, most importantly, it is both **machine and human readable.**\\n\\nExtra Reading\\n\\nSpeckle\\'s decomposition api is described in more depth [here](/dev/decomposition)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#wrapping-up)\\n Wrapping Up\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThis post covered the low level building blocks of Speckle and how they work together. The key points and concepts that we\\'ve covered are:\\n\\n*   How apps interact with Speckle, and how data can be translated between them: either directly, or through Speckle kits.\\n*   How data gets serialised, and subsequently stored & how these two layers interact.\\n*   How Speckle treats objects and decomposes them into their constituent parts.\\n*   What Transports are, and why they\\'re so powerful: they allow completely new backends to Speckle to be written and composed.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/architecture.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Introduction](/dev/) [The Base Object](/dev/base.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Architecture | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/architecture.html'}),\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-the-base-object/782)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe Base object is one of the smallest, yet most critical parts of our SDKs as it influences the serialisation & deserialisation process, hashing speed & correctness, overall performance, and how elements are defined in the Speckleverse. It\\'s the building block of Speckle.\\n\\nIn this page we\\'ll describe what it is and how to use it in more detail. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#using-base)\\n Using `Base`\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe base object class (actually called `Base`) is the foundation of all data being transferred with Speckle. Any custom data structure that you want to transfer via Speckle should inherit from it. You can read more on creating your own schemas in the [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n\\n`Base` inherits from a C# dynamic object. This allows us to be strongly typed when needed, but as well fall back elegantly on dynamic properties when we want to, or need to. Imagine a crossover between a JavaScript object and a strongly defined C# class. It\\'s quite cool! Furthermore, this removes some of the friction in aligning with our Python and JS implementations.\\n\\nThis is what it looks like:\\n\\n    // Simplified class definition:\\n    public class Base {\\n    \\tpublic string id { get; set; } // this is the unique hash, generated from the serialized object\\n        \\tpublic string applicationId { get; set; } // a secondary (optional) identity value, for example the host application object id\\n    \\tpublic string speckle_type { get; } // this is the discriminator comprised of assembly name and inheritance\\n    \\tpublic long totalChildrenCount { get; } // this is the total number of detachable objects\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n### [#](#direct-usage)\\n Direct Usage\\n\\nHere\\'s how you would use a \"raw\" `Base` object as a custom data structure. It\\'s essentially just a dynamic object at heart.\\n\\n    var myObject = new Base();\\n    \\n    // setting properties using dot notation requires cast to dynamic\\n    ((dynamic)myObject).myNewProperty = \"foo\";\\n    \\n    // alternatively, just pretend it\\'s a dictionary!\\n    myObject[\"myNewProperty2\"] = \"bar\";\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nYou can define singular objects like this - like something representing a built element; alternatively you can define your own object collection types based on the source application you\\'re working from.\\n\\n    var myCommit = new Base();\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A\"] = new List<Base>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-B\"] = new List<Point>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A:RhinoLayer-C\"] = new List<String>() { ... };\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n✋ All property names will need to be serializable and some characters prevent this. With dot notation this is more obvious, but using the dictionary method, invalid prop names will only show up at serialization time. There is a helper function `IsPropNameValid` within `DynamicBase` that you could use to check whenever you are dealing with handling indeterminate properties from other software. It also checks for double special characters or overwritten instance property names.\\n\\n### [#](#inherited-usage)\\n Inherited Usage\\n\\nOf course, you can define custom classes that inherit from `Base` and define strongly typed properties in there, which can then be accessed as usual; these can easily coexist alongside dynamic ones.\\n\\n    public class Point : Base {\\n      // define a set of strongly typed properties\\n      public double x { get; set; }\\n      public double y { get; set; }\\n      public double z { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Strongly typed props behave as you would expect them to:\\n    var myPt = new Point();\\n    myPt.x = 10;\\n    var whatIsX = myPt.x;\\n    \\n    // With a dynamic property, things are a bit more verbose, but still manageable:\\n    ((dynamic)myPt).bar = \"baz\";\\n    var whatIsBar = ((dynamic)myPt).bar as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    // Alternative syntax, if you actually pass the property name at runtime:\\n    var whatIsBar = myPt[\"bar\"] as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nSetting a dynamic property that overlaps with a strongly typed one will actually just set the strongly typed one 🙂\\n\\nAll kit object models are inheriting from the `Base` object class for their object definitions. This ensures that Speckle will be able to transport them!\\n\\n[#](#detaching)\\n Detaching @\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen defining your dynamic `Base` object properties, you can detach them by prepending an `@` to your property name like so:\\n\\n    public class Foo : Base { }\\n    public class Bar : Base { }\\n    \\n    var foo = new Foo();\\n    var bar = new Bar();\\n    \\n    foo[\"@bar\"] = bar;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nDetaching a property stores that property value as a reference to another object. Why do this? Since it\\'s possible to nest your `Base` inherited class objects, detaching any properties that may be assigned an object used by other objects keeps your data squeaky clean. Since detached objects are only serialized once during transport, detaching when appropriate means faster sending and receiving times as well ⚡\\n\\nFor a more in depth rundown of detachables and examples, check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#hashing)\\n Hashing\\n----------------------\\n\\nAs you may or may not know, objects in Speckle are immutable. That means that if you change a property of one, it essentially gets a whole new identity; it\\'s a whole new object (as far as the storage layer is concerned). This immutability is enforced through unique hashes that are dependent on the object\\'s properties.\\n\\nAs a developer, you don\\'t need to care about all this 🙌. Our SDKs takes care of correctly setting the hash of an object, at the correct time: at the end of the serialisation process. There\\'s another purely cosmetic change that we made: the hash is now stored in an field called `id`. Why? Mostly so it\\'s clear that it\\'s the single object identity mechanism that **should** be used across all storage layers.\\n\\nWhat about operations that are dependent on hashes? From our analysis of existing programmatic usage, you rarely really need the hash of an object before serialising (and, implicitly, storing it somewhere). When retrieving objects from \"somewhere\" (more on this in another post), the hash already exists, so you can check against an existing application state and manage updates.\\n\\n    var x = myObject.id; // will be populated only if this object has been previously serialised!\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIf you really need the hash (id!) before serialising it, don\\'t panic! You can still generate it - nevertheless we\\'ve put that behind an explicit function call so you, as a developer, are aware of the extra cost that you will be incurring. Here\\'s how the signature of that function looks like:\\n\\n    /// <summary>\\n    /// Gets the id (a unique hash) of this object. ⚠️ This method fully serializes the object, which in the case of large objects (with many sub-objects), has a tangible cost.\\n    /// <para><b>Hint:</b> Objects that are retrieved/pulled from a server/local cache do have an id (hash) property pre-populated.</para>\\n    /// <para><b>Note:</b>The hash of a decomposed object differs from the hash of a non-decomposed object.</para>\\n    /// </summary>\\n    /// <param name=\"decompose\">If true, will decompose the object in the process of hashing.</param>\\n    /// <returns></returns>\\n    public string GetId(bool decompose = false) { }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nNoticed that `decompose` flag? You\\'re sharp - check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n for more.\\n\\n[#](#the-speckle-objects-kit)\\n The Speckle Objects Kit\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur SDKs come with our in-house Objects Kit comprised of `Base` inherited classes for your standard AEC needs. The core geometry kit contains all your basic elements like Points, Lines, Curves, and Breps, which are then used as properties for our more extensively defined BIM, Structural, and Civil elements. Read more in our [Objects section](/dev/objects)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#displaying-base)\\n Displaying `Base`\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to the `Base` properties in our model above, you may also encounter certain common properties when exploring your data in our web viewer. The objects in our Objects Kit come with properties that we use to display them in our frontend:\\n\\n    // Class definition with additional display properties\\n    public class Foo : Base {\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; } // Mesh objects that represent the geometry of this Base object, e.g. used to render surfaces, or solid objects in our viewer\\n    \\t// or\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic Polyline displayValue { get; set; } // a polyline used to render complex curve objects in our viewer\\n    \\t\\n    \\tpublic Box bbox { get; set; } // a bounding box used to assist with object selection in our viewer\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is a **special property** within the Objects kit. It is common for classes inheriting `Base` to represent complex, conceptual, or domain specific objects. The `displayValue` property can be used to provide a **geometric representation** to help display the object in applications that don\\'t have a native form.\\n\\nFor example, When receiving **BIM types** like `Wall`, `Floor`, `Beam`, etc into a **non-BIM application** like Rhino, Unity, or our web viewer, these applications **have no way of rendering these elements natively**. The `displayValue` property represents **fallback** geometry, that will automatically be used by applications when receiving types without a native conversion.\\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is expected to be either an **object inheriting `Base`** or a **`List` of objects inheriting `Base`**. Ideally, these types **should be simple geometry types** like `Mesh` or `Polyline` as these can be converted in all (or almost all) receiving applications (However, this rule isn\\'t enforced for custom `Base` objects, and in theory, any type inheriting `Base` can be used .)\\n\\n[#](#collections)\\n Collections\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhether to represent Layers, Categories, Tags, Collections, Groups, or hierarchical containers, it is common to see a natural grouping of objects within a 3D model. The `Collection` type provides a unified way to represent hierarchical collections of Speckle objects in a queryable, filterable way and is useful for interoperability between applications.\\n\\nA collection object only has three properties (in addition to those inherited from the `Base` Speckle object) and is completely kit/domain agnostic.\\n\\n> `name` - Any (non-empty) human-readable `string` name, one not necessarily unique.\\n> \\n> `collectionType` - Any `string` value describing the type of collection, used for convenience, and specific interop.\\n> \\n> `elements` - A `List<Base>` representing child objects, may include nested `Collection` objects.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur new front-end (fe2) is designed to display `Collection` in the scene explorer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/fe2-collections.4509cd2c.gif)\\n\\nSuppose we look at how Collection objects are used inside Speckle versions. We see within the Collection’s `elements` property; we can expect any objects to be nested, including sub-collections.\\n\\nImportantly, however, we only see `Collection` objects nested under other `Collections`. Unlike other speckle objects which may form any [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n structure, Collections must be in a true directed tree structure.\\n\\n> ![](/assets/img/collection-tree-structure.2601314c.png)\\n> \\n> Diagram of collections within a Speckle commit, illustrating collections can contain both sub-collections and other objects under the `elements` property.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-decomposition-api/911)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers how Speckle deals with the structure and composition of design data. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#blobs-and-trees)\\n Blobs and Trees\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nDesign and construction data is mostly relational: **built elements link to each other.** Despite this, there is no canonical way of structuring it. How do they relate to each other? Well, it depends!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/cb099e4d3a8553053869d791f0ce1fcaebca3c7a_2_690x295.png)\\n\\nFor example, a `Site` object may contain one or more `Building` objects. These, in turn, may contain one more `Levels`, and each of these `Levels` may contain some `Walls`, `Floor` and `Beam` elements. Or, those `Building` objects may each individually reference the same `Site`. Within the `Building` object, there\\'s all the `Walls` and `Beams`, and each of them, rather than being grouped under a `Level`, they individually reference a specific `Level`.\\n\\nIn order to solve this, we\\'ve taken a good look at how git, the ubiquitous version control system, works. Git operates with two object types: blobs and trees. Blobs represent files, and an important characteristic is that they are immutable - just like objects are in Speckle. Trees represent folders, and they are used to track the hierarchy of the folder structure of your repository.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you think this analogy hints to more, you\\'re right: Speckle is becoming a fully fledged version control system for design data. Keep an eye out 😎\\n\\nAs opposed to Git, that deals with data structured on your hard drive, Speckle deals with data structured in memory. In Speckle, an object is, at the same time, both a blob (data) and a tree (its subcomponents). There are two separate, yet interweaved, problems (and their corollaries) that I\\'ll now address:\\n\\n*   How to decompose an object? _(Corollary: how to recompose an object?)_\\n*   How to serialise, transport and store that decomposed object? _(Corollary: how to retrieve and deserialise an object?)_\\n\\n[#](#decomposing)\\n Decomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong way to structure design data. Different applications operate with different models, different use-cases require different hierarchies, different disciplines and professionals operate with differently structured ontologies.\\n\\nSpeckle now has a mechanism by which, in the process of specifying an object - either via a strongly typed kit, or via dynamic properties - developers (and end-users) can decide what gets decomposed and what doesn\\'t.\\n\\n### [#](#strongly-typed-detachment)\\n Strongly Typed Detachment\\n\\nIt works, in the case of strongly typed properties, by adding the Speckle specific attribute `[DetachProperty]` on the properties you want to store as references, rather than within the object itself.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s take an imaginary set of classes:\\n\\n    public class Building : Base {\\n      [DetachProperty] // this attribute tells Speckle to store the value of the Site separately.\\n      public Site Site { get; set; }\\n      public List<Level> Levels { get; set; }\\n      public Owner { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public class Level : Base {\\n      public double height { get; set; } = 3.2;\\n      public double baseElevation {get; set; } = 0;\\n    \\n      [DetachProperty]\\n      public List<Base> Elements { get; set; } // The actual walls, floors, columns, etc.\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Define a site globally\\n    var mySite = new Site();\\n    \\n    // Reference the same site in both buildings.\\n    buildingA.Site = mySite;\\n    buildingB.Site = mySite;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nWhen an instance of the Building class gets saved, the `Site` will be stored separately. If two Buildings share the same `Site`, it will be stored only once, and each instance of the `Building` class will hold a reference to the same `Site`.\\n\\nIn our example, each Level can hold, in a _detachable_ property, all its walls, beams, ducts, pipes, furniture, and other built elements. Consequently, each of these elements will be individually accessible from the storage layer, and will maintain topological unity. Why is this important? Let\\'s imagine a building with a series of levels separated by floor slabs. **The slab between two levels pertains to which level: the bottom one, or the top one?**\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/original/1X/3ea9d660024d5f3545933133165737e063fa87d5.png)\\n\\nCollections\\n\\nThe most generic class used in Speckle is the `Collection` class. The `Collection` class is a `Base` class that has the `elements` property, which is a `List<Base>`. This means that any object that inherits from `Base` can be stored in a `Collection` object. This is a very powerful concept, as it allows us to store arbitrary data structures in Speckle, without paying any penalties. While it is mostly used for representing parent-child relationships, those children can be of any type, and because `elements` is detached they can also be stored in multiple collections.\\n\\n### [#](#dynamic-detachment)\\n Dynamic Detachment\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this through an example that also demonstrates how dynamically added properties can be detached. We\\'ll assume that we will dynamically set `topSlab` and `bottomSlab` properties to each level in our imaginary object model:\\n\\n    // We\\'re grossly simplifying in this example. Here are our two building levels:\\n    var level_1, level_2;\\n    \\n    // The philosophical slab instance. Does it belong to level 1 or level 2?\\n    var slab_between_1_and_2 = new Slab();\\n    \\n    // Well, it belongs to both! Notice the \"@\" character at the beginning of\\n    // the dynamic property assignment - it\\'s the Speckle convention for \"detaching\"\\n    // dynamically added properties.\\n    level_1[\"@topSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    level_2[\"@bottomSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nBecause we\\'ve prepended the property name with an \"@\" symbol, Speckle will now \"detach\" it. Consequently, once stored, both level one and two will now hold a reference to a single slab! Beyond storage efficiency - the slab is only stored once - **this approach gives us the freedom to structure data however is best and, simultaneously, query, slice and dice it however we need to.**\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s assume you need to do a quantity takeoffs:\\n\\n*   For each each individual level: specify the total surface area, including walls, ceilings, etc. Solution: simply retrieve each level individually!\\n*   For the whole building: calculate the total volume of concrete that goes into the slabs. Solution: just query the building object for all the slabs!\\n\\nSimilarly, imagine you\\'ve written a script that does environmental analysis on a given level. The level can now be retrieved in its entirety - without juggling around to bring in the level above it too, just to get the ceiling out. Once the results are calculated, they can be stored in a detachable property on that specific level (e.g., `level_1[@\"solarComfortMeshWithColours\"] = analysisResultMesh;`). Later down the line in your workflow, one can could query for all the \"`solarComfortMeshWithColours`\" objects individually for each level, or, if needed, for the whole building.\\n\\n[#](#recomposing)\\n Recomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nRecomposition of an object happens within the deserialisation process, and it\\'s tightly integrated with the transport layer. The process, on the surface, is deceivingly simple. When you ask Speckle to receive a specific object, the process is as follows:\\n\\n*   Speckle retrieves said object\\'s \"blob\" (actually a JSON string representation of it),\\n*   Next up, Speckle retrieves at all the reference tree of this object,\\n*   Speckle proceeds to deserialise and re-compose the parent object, inserting in the place of references the actual referenced object.\\n\\nWether or not this sounds complicated, the exposed API is actually rather simple and the end result is that a decomposed object, when received back, will be identical with the original one - with all its parts in place 💥\\n\\n[#](#chunking)\\n Chunking\\n------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#problem)\\n Problem\\n\\nSome list properties of various objects can get very large. Examples:\\n\\n*   a Brep with many faces will have a Surfaces list prop containing 1000s of potentially heavy Surfaces.\\n*   a mesh with 100k+ vertices and faces.\\n\\nThis results in a clunky (memory heavy) serialisation process and can be unsafe (read: cause breakages) due to memory limitations.\\n\\n### [#](#solutions)\\n Solutions\\n\\nIn order of preference. Note that they are not exclusive, and they build on top of each other:\\n\\n*   First, optimise the list property so it\\'s more lightweight\\n*   Second, chunk the list property\\n\\n### [#](#first-port-of-call-optimise-the-list-property-🧪)\\n First Port of Call: Optimise the List Property 🧪\\n\\nFor example, you might be tempted to define a mesh like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        public List<Point> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nA much more efficient way is to define it like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n      // Typed array of 3\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\nInstead of storing each individual vertex as a point, you store them in a typed array. Serialisation will be much faster and leaner.\\n\\n### [#](#second-port-of-call-use-the-chunkable-attribute-🆕)\\n Second Port of Call: Use the `Chunkable` Attribute 🆕\\n\\nIn some cases you might be too lazy to actually optimise the storage of a list property, or it might be too convenient to use the class itself.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might still have a simple `List<double>` that expands to millions+ of items, like in the case of a very large mesh.\\n\\nIn the cases above, the best way is to mark the property as `Chunkable` together with `[DetachProperty]`. This will tell the serialiser that it should split it into manageable chunks of items, the size of which you can control.\\n\\nHere\\'s how that looks like currently in the mesh class:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> faces { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> colors { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> textureCoordinates { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nPotential Footguns\\n\\nThe DetachProperty attribute by itself can be a performance footgun in some scenarios: for example, if you have a `List<Point>` that can grow really big and you mark it as detachable, without marking it as chunkable, each individual point in that list will be stored as a separate entity.\\n\\nThis is bad: serialisation and deserialisation will take longer, and it essentially amounts to bad object model design (in speckle terms of course).\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nEnd users and developers can now productively control the way they structure their design data through the decomposition mechanism. From the point of view of the future Speckle connectors, this will enable us to expose object model flexibility in a more elegant way than before to end users. As developers, Speckle gives you another powerful API on top of which you can scaffold your digital automation workflows.\\n\\nMore importantly, this allows you to store arbitrary data structures (scaffolded on top of a `Base`) with Speckle, without paying any penalties: **Speckle deals equally well with flat and nested data.**\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/decomposition.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [The Base Object](/dev/base.html) [Kits](/dev/kits.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Decomposition API | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/decomposition.html'}),\n",

They are, in a nutshell, a package consisting of:\\n\\n*   **an object model** that defines the structure of the data\\n*   **a set of converters**, implementations for various AEC authoring applications (ie, conversion routines that make the translations happen)\\n\\nWhenever a connector is \"sending to Speckle\", it needs to convert data (lines, points, beams, doors, etc.) into this intermediate object model. Upon receiving, the opposite process happens.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\n**Kits are not tied into the core of Speckle, they are pluggable.** Anyone can add/remove them as they wish or develop their own.\\n\\n[#](#how-kits-work)\\n How Kits Work\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nA kit is assumed to be able to handle all element types, geometries and disciplines in use by a user/team/company. This is a core difference from previous iterations of Speckle. If multiple kits are available on a user machine, the user (or system administrators) will be responsible of selecting the default kit.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\nWhen a connector needs to convert an object, it will only search for available conversion routines in the selected kit and will not automatically fall back on other kits - this might change in the future!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f9890eead0fb8aa7bbe141a6cf7dd16453b0d176_2_690x449.png)\\n\\n[#](#objects)\\n Objects\\n----------------------\\n\\nObjects is the name of our default kit.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-transports/919)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers what Transports are and do and the basic concepts behind them. [Here can read how to write your own transport](/dev/transports-dev)\\n. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most common use-cases we\\'ve encountered throughout the past 5 years of interacting with developers from the AEC space is \"dumping data somewhere\", and, obviously, getting it back out again. While this can, of course, be done by using the Speckle server, some situations call for a different storage type or database. We\\'ve seen people looking to use files on a network drive, Azure SQL provisions, MongoDB, Excel files, and sometimes [core rope memory (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory)\\n (joking, we\\'ve never seen that one - yet!).\\n\\nAn important part of our mission at Speckle is to empower developers across AEC. We want to give you a leg up so you can \"automate all the things\" and build powerful applications that leverage modern tech.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports give developers in the AEC space full control over where and how their data is stored.\\n\\nYou can now switch, choose and mix various storage layers. This allows us to write better, more memory efficient and predictable connectors. It also allows you, as a developer, to use Speckle as a springboard in your development work in a much more flexible way.\\n\\n[#](#definitions)\\n Definitions\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we dive in and see how they work, let\\'s get some definitions out of the way:\\n\\n### [#](#transports-2)\\n Transports\\n\\nIn Speckle, transports take Speckle Objects from memory and persist it to a specific storage layer. Of course, they\\'re also responsible for taking those objects out of the storage layer and back into memory.\\n\\n### [#](#storage-layers)\\n Storage Layers\\n\\nThe storage layer that a transport writes to can be, ultimately, anything you want it to be. The .NET SDK implements already a few of them, specifically:\\n\\n*   an SQLite Transport\\n*   an In-Memory Transport\\n*   **a Speckle Server 2.0 Transport**\\n*   a Disk Transport\\n*   a MongoDB Transport\\n\\nOther possible targets for transports can be S3 storage, a network drive, etc. You can also write a transport that writes to more than one place, but we advise against it - the .NET SDK provides a better way to achieve the same thing.\\n\\nMoreover, in the case of disk based transports (ie, disk, sqlite, etc.) you can also **control the location** of where this data is stored.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data-serialisation-and-writing)\\n Sending Data: Serialisation and Writing\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSerialisation is a potentially quite wasteful operation depending on the size of the data. One of our goals is to be able to support arbitrarily large models without adding too much overhead.\\n\\n> Why can serialisation be wasteful, especially in terms of memory usage? Imagine you have a model with 100k building objects (geometry & data) open in an application. To send that model to Speckle, we would need to (1) convert those objects into Speckle objects, using a given converter, then (2) serialise them to whatever format we\\'d be ingesting down the line (e.g., a JSON string), and, finally, (3) transport them to Speckle. Over the course of these steps, your computer\\'s memory holds **_three_** representations of the same object - Native, Speckle, and String. Not that cool! To reduce memory overhead, Speckle now integrates serialisation with writing objects to one or more persistence layers via transports. Whenever an object finishes serialisation, it\\'s sent to a transport for storage, and ultimately, its string representation gets \"garbage collected\". Just like this, we\\'ve knocked off some memory usage.\\n\\nThe 2.0 API exposes two lower level methods for sending (serialising and writing) and receiving (reading and deserialising) data. In this section, we\\'ll look at only at the send one - the section below will provide more detail on receiving data.\\n\\nFirst off, let\\'s start with the simplest, default, use case:\\n\\n    // First, let\\'s create a simple base object to store our building data in.\\n    var myData = new Base();\\n    myData[\"@columns\"] = new List<Columns>() { ... the columns };\\n    myData[\"@rooms\"] = new List<Rooms>() { ... the rooms};\\n    \\n    // Let\\'s now send the data:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nLooks quite simple! In this scenario, the `Send` method serialised and saved the `myData` object, together with all its detachable `columns` and `rooms` to the default Speckle local transport (an SQLite db stored in `~/AppData/Speckle`), and returned the id (hash) of the `myData` object, which you can use to receive it back again.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at a more advanced example:\\n\\n    var myRevisionId = await Operations.Send(\\n    \\tmyData,\\n    \\ttransports: new ITransport[] {\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // imagine this one server...\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // ... and this is a different one! you\\'re basically pushing to multiple remotes!\\n    \\t  new MyCustomTransport( args ) // ... and, why not another transport?\\n      }\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening here is that we\\'re passing in multiple transports to the Send method. Speckle will persist the given object, with all its detachable sub-children, to all these transports, and, when done, return the object\\'s id (hash!).\\n\\n[#](#receiving-data-reading-and-deserialisation)\\n Receiving Data: Reading and Deserialisation\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, let\\'s start with the simplest use-case possible:\\n\\n    // To set the stage, in the previous code sample, we\\'ve done:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n    // Now, we want to get it back out. It\\'s as simple as:\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive( myDataId );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nThis just retrieves the object back using the default SQLite Transport. No accounts, no extra HTTP requests, no hassle. Of course, this is enough only for \"local\" operations that are bound to a single computer only.\\n\\nIf you want this to work across a local network, you can always create a SQLite Transport (or your own custom transport for that matter) that stores data on a network accessible drive. For large collaborative environments, you can, of course, receive your data from a Speckle Server.\\n\\nWhile you can Send data to multiple places at the same time, you can\\'t really receive data from more places at the same time. Hence, `Receive` can only accept one transport as the source:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n    \\tmyDataId,\\n    \\tremoteTransport: new ServerTransport( ... ) // where you want to receive things from!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nDone! `myData` is now your data - a nicely deserialised Base object.\\n\\n[#](#advanced-transports)\\n Advanced Transports\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Send and Receive functions in the examples above assume **a shared global cache** located in `~/User/.config/Speckle`. In the case of Send, this means that objects will be written to a SQLite Transport that is used by Speckle always; in the case of Receive, the same SQLite Transport will be used to buffer to/from the remote transport.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are some use cases where you don\\'t want to, or cannot, use the shared global cache. For example, you would want to go full on classic version control, and store your history right next to your project\\'s file:\\n\\n    `-- MyProject_A            # root folder\\n        |-- .speckle           # the \".git\" folder\\n        |   |-- references.db  # commits, branches, tags, etc. storage\\n        |   `-- objects.db     # object storage\\n        `-- MyProject_A.rvt    # source file\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nHow would you actually implement such a system?\\n\\nFirst, you can always customise the location of your transport. For example, in the case of the SQLite Transport, you can specify a folder where to actually create it. Let\\'s assume we want to send our data to only two transports, a local SQLite one that\\'s sitting in the `.speckle` folder just next to our Revit file, and a Speckle Server.\\n\\n    var customLocalTransport = new SQLiteTransport( basePath: @\"{localFolderPath}/.speckle\" );\\n    var serverTransport = new ServerTransport(...);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThe `Send` method can take an optional `useDefaultCache: false` argument to bypass the global cache, and send exclusively to the provided transports:\\n\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send(\\n      myData,\\n      transports: new ITransport[] { customLocalTransport, serverTransport },\\n      useDefaultCache: false // will bypass the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nWhen receiving data, if you want to use your custom local transport, the method would look like this:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId: myDataId,\\n      remoteTransport: serverTransport,\\n      localTransport: customLocalTransport // will use this one instead of the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nAnother use case is in constrained environments, where you don\\'t have a persistent storage layer handy, such as a serverless function, or docker container. That\\'s where you would probably want to use a `MemoryTransport` - it\\'s obviously much faster and it doesn\\'t need to touch the disk.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nTransports give you, as a developer, a lot of flexibility in how you can use Speckle, so hopefully \"automating all the things\" will become a bit easier and nicer. They make it easy to customise your workflows and where and how you store data - from the Speckle Server, to one or more databases, local or remote.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/transports.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 8/1/2021, 10:56:30 AM\\n\\n← [Kits](/dev/kits.html) [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Transports | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/transports.html'}),\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/apps-authn-speckle-2-0/961)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a quick post on how authentication with the server works; we\\'ve put in _a lot_ of effort to make it easier for developers to extend the functionality of Speckle in their own apps, and simultaneously more secure for end users.\\n\\nBefore we start, we\\'d like to clarify that this post refers to specifically **authentication**, and not authorization.\\n\\n*   Authorization (authZ) controls **who has access to what resource**; it\\'s not the focus of this post.\\n*   Authentication (authN) controls **how a user can delegate access to other applications** (pieces of software) that then act on their behalf.\\n\\n[#](#api-tokens)\\n API Tokens\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAll access to the API is done through bearer tokens that need to present in the Authorization header of each request. There are several ways to create/obtain these tokens, which we\\'ll describe below. First, a few important notes on _tokens in general_:\\n\\n### [#](#token-scopes)\\n Token Scopes\\n\\nEach token has a set of associated scopes to it which **limit what actions it can do**. For example, you could have a token that is only allowed to read streams and your profile information. Alternatively, you could have a token that is allowed to search for other users on the server, read your existing streams, create new ones, etc.\\n\\nAs Speckle will grow with functionality, new scopes will be made available. Currently there are:\\n\\n    let coreModuleScopes = [\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"server:setup\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Edit server information.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your api tokens.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:write\",\\\\\\n        description: `Create and delete api tokens on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:read\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Read your streams & and any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:write\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Create streams on your behalf and read your streams & any associated information (any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read your profile information`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:email\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your email.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read other users\\' profile on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:email\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Access the emails of other users.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n    ];\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n\\n### [#](#token-lifetime)\\n Token Lifetime\\n\\nTokens also have a certain lifetime after which they\\'re no longer valid. This helps with automatically blocking access to long forgotten apps. Written a little script two years ago that you\\'ve totally forgot about, but the token\\'s nicely pasted in the codebase since you\\'ve never published it? Well, now that\\'s safe even if someone else somehow snitches it - it probably expired.\\n\\n[#](#personal-access-tokens)\\n Personal Access Tokens\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs a developer, you can now create personal access tokens that you can use to delegate access to your script on your behalf, similar to how Github\\'s [Personal Access Tokens (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\\n work.\\n\\nWhen you create them, you can assign assign to them whatever scopes & lifetime you want to, just remember to limit both to the minimum to be _safe._\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTo create a new token head over `YOUR-SPECKLE-SERVER\\\\profile`\\n\\n[#](#apps)\\n Apps\\n----------------\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/109046703-f45be080-76cc-11eb-83b3-27ed956ff319.png)\\n\\nOnce you\\'re beyond the hacking phase, you\\'ll probably want to create & publish a speckle app that others can use. As a developer, you can:\\n\\n*   register apps that others can use (or not),\\n*   manage the apps you have created - edit name, description, redirect url, scopes, and delete.\\n\\nOnce an app is registered on a server, users can now delegate access to it for the set of scopes that the developer registered for that application. Once the delegation process is successful - the user approves it - they will get redirected to the url that the developer specified.\\n\\nOf course, as an end user, you have full control and visibility on the apps you have authorized. You can:\\n\\n*   see all your authorized apps (apps that you have granted access to),\\n*   revoke access to any of the above,\\n*   check out any publicly listed apps on this server (optional at this stage)\\n\\n### [#](#extras-on-app-types)\\n Extras on app types:\\n\\nNote: broadly speaking, there are two type of apps:\\n\\n*   Apps that act on behalf of a user - **supported ✅**\\n*   Apps that can act with their own identity - **not currently supported ⏱**\\n\\nWe\\'ll write soon more documentation on how the authentication flow with the Server actually works. For the geeks out there, here\\'s a short summary, or some important points:\\n\\n*   We are supporting the **authorization\\\\_code** flow with **PKCE** only for public and confidential clients.\\n*   We do not support dynamic scope requests for apps. We **only support pre-registered scopes for each app**.\\n*   If an app is edited in any way - name, scopes, etc. - all its tokens get revoked and users will need to re-authorize it.\\n\\nClients are usually split into two categories: public and private. Public clients cannot realistically hold a secret, whereas private ones can. For example, a front-end only web application is a public client; same goes for the desktop connectors. A private client can be a server-side application, which can realistically store an application secret in, for example, a .env file or provide it during the CI/CD process.\\n\\nClients are protected by:\\n\\n*   Using exclusively a pre-registered redirect URL.\\n*   Native apps (desktop): registering a custom application scheme (`speckle://`).\\n*   PKCE (Proof of Key For Code Exchange).\\n*   a client id & client secret, but the clientSecret is superfluous in the case of public clients.\\n\\n[#](#examples)\\n Examples\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe 2.0 server already comes with two applications that demonstrate this flow (warning - there might still be bugs). These are:\\n\\n*   The main web frontend application - accessible at the server\\'s default url, and\\n*   The GraphQL explorer - accessible at your server\\'s url + `/explorer`.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve put a lot of work into making Speckle developer friendly and extensible - and apps are just a small part of that. We hope that writing Speckle Apps will be fun and effective, and we can\\'t wait to see what you\\'ll do with them!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/apps-auth.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Transports](/dev/transports.html) [Introduction](/dev/dotnet.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Apps and Auth | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/apps-auth.html'}),\n",

To do so (and avoid worrying about authentication), we first need to set up a [personal access token](/dev/tokens)\\n.\\n\\nThen, we can create a basic `Account` and pass it to a new `Client` and use the API as usual, see full example below:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Credentials;\\n    using System;\\n    \\n    namespace SpeckleSampleApp\\n    {\\n      class Program\\n      {\\n        static void Main(string[] args)\\n        {\\n          var account = new Account();\\n          account.token = \"YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN\";\\n          account.serverInfo = new ServerInfo\\n          {\\n            url = \"https://app.speckle.systems/\"\\n          };\\n    \\n          var client = new Client(account);\\n          var stream = client.StreamGet(\"5dfbeb49c9\").Result;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nAlternatively, if you don\\'t want to use a personal access token you\\'d need to take care of the auth flow yourself, this functionality is not currently present in Core.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/dotnet.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/3/2024, 8:37:44 PM\\n\\n← [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html) [Filtering and Flattening Speckle Data in .NET](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Introduction | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/dotnet.html'}),\n",

Without a method to navigate through complex, hierarchical data structures, you might end up with partial or incorrect data representations. Traversal provides a systematic way to explore Speckle data while capturing the relational context between objects.\\n\\nThe most basic way to consume Speckle objects is simply **[by flattening the Speckle data](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n**, and consuming objects one by one. For many use cases, this is all that is required, but often it is necessary to consume Speckle objects **while capturing the hierarchical context of objects**.\\n\\n**In connectors**, this means traversing received Speckle data **to find convertible objects and their children**. In these cases, we are converting more than just objects one by one, but also **preserving the hierarchical tree** of parent/child relationships.\\n\\nSo, What is Traversal?\\n\\nIn practical terms, Traversal is **how we navigate Speckle data** and the relationships between Speckle Objects, to **consume objects with hierarchical context.**\\n\\nTo be concise, traversal aims to transform the [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n topology (_Think of it as a one-way network of objects; no loops allowed_) of a Speckle data **into a pure [tree (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\\n topology** (_a branching hierarchy_).\\n\\nThe structure of a Speckle data (e.g. from a version) differs depending on the data sent and from which connector. While it is possible to write code that manually traverses a specific version, by **hardcoding assumptions** its structure, it is often desirable to **write code that can consume any Speckle data, sent from any connector**. For this, it is necessary to understand the common **rules for how the connectors structure data**, and how this data can be traversed.\\n\\nThis concept is most useful in connectors when receiving and converting data, but the concept of traversal applies for any use case with the need to preserve and transform the structure of data.\\n\\nSimply iterating through all Speckle objects and consuming them individually is insufficient. Many types of **objects contain several representations** and reference geometry objects that are part of their definition (rather than separate displayable objects).\\n\\nTo illustrate this, consider how the `Wall` object is defined:\\n\\n    public class Wall : Base\\n    {\\n        public double height { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public ICurve baseLine { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public string units { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Base> elements { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nThe `baseLine` curve forms part of the definition of the wall. And the `displayValue` provides a purely polygonal **mesh representation** of the mesh for display.\\n\\nA naïve function that consumes all objects one by one would **blindly consume** the baseline curve, and each mesh `displayValue` **without context** that it’s part of the Wall, nor do we have selectivity to choose which representation is use.\\n\\nFor these objects, it is necessary to be **selective about which properties should be traversed deeper**.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/selective-traversal.9b472fa6.png)\\n\\nWithin the Speckle connectors, **A `Wall` object is considered a convertible object**; the `baseLine` and `displayValue` representations **should be ignored** from being traversed.\\n\\nThis is where traversal functions come into play. These functions **encode the “rules” for which properties should be traversed**. And provides a convenient way to traverse Speckle data without making connector-specific assumptions about its structure.\\n\\nThe **Default Traversal Function** provides a de jure method of traversing Speckle objects, designed around a Speckle converter. This function is used by most of our connectors (with slight deviation) when receiving Speckle objects.\\n\\nIn general, a connector considers an object to be either:\\n\\n*   Convertible directly through a `ToNative` function\\n*   Convertible using displayValue (through a fall-back display value)\\n*   Convertible indirectly (through another conversion, as is the case for, say, `RenderMaterial`)\\n*   Not convertible at all\\n\\nDifferent connectors will have **different definitions of a “convertible” object**. There is no definitive list of “convertible” Speckle types. Connector-specific flexibility allows for **targeted interop** workflows and allows for the **intricacies of each host application**.\\n\\nAs part of the default traversal rules, we selectively traverse the properties of “convertible” objects. Only traversing `\"elements\"` (and its alias `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nAll other non-”convertible” objects will be traversed blindly (i.e. they have all properties traversed).\\n\\nCollections are a special case, As we handle them slightly differently depending on the connector. Some connectors (on receive) ignore all collection structures and convert objects the best way the native application allows. Others will use them to construct Layers, Tags, Collections, Groups etc.\\n\\nBe careful when dynamically attaching data to `Collection` objects to avoid inconsistent behaviour. We would advise keeping `\"elements\"` as the only traversed property. This is something we may consider enforcing in a future version of Core. This doesn’t mean you can’t use dynamic properties on collections, but it does avoid dynamically attaching geometry.\\n\\n[#](#using-the-traversal-functions)\\n Using the Traversal Functions\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor most use cases, the `DefaultTraversal` function can be used out of the box to consume Speckle objects individually while still retaining the object hierarchy (tree).\\n\\nThe below case demonstrates the `DefaultTraversal` implementation and how it can be used to iterate through the Tree. The `TraversalContext` objects are the tree nodes that contain the `current: Base` object and the `parent : TraveralContext`. Additionally, they contain the name of the parent’s property that was traversed to get to current.\\n\\n    async Task Foo(string myStream, ISpeckleConverter myConverter)\\n    {\\n        // Initialize traversal function with the given converter\\n        var traversalFunc = DefaultTraversal.CreateTraverseFunc(myConverter);\\n    \\n        // Receive commit object from the stream\\n        Base commitObject = await Helpers.Receive(myStream);\\n    \\n        // Traverse the commit object\\n        foreach (TraversalContext context in traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject))\\n        {\\n            // Get the current object in traversal\\n            Base current = context.current;\\n    \\n            // Get the parent of the current object\\n            TraversalContext? parent = context.parent;\\n    \\n            // Perform some operation on the current object\\n            // Replace `DoWork` with your actual functionality\\n            DoWork(current);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n\\nThe above code can be adapted to perform common tasks, such as\\n\\n*   Filter for walls\\n\\n    List<Wall> walls = traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .OfType<Wall>()\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n*   Filter for all objects by volume\\n\\n    List<Base> smallThings = traversalFunc\\n          .Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .Where(b => b[\"Volume\"] is double and < 20)\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n[#](#the-traversal-rule-builder)\\n The Traversal Rule Builder\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we delve into customizing traversal rules, let\\'s establish the default rules that are applied during traversal:\\n\\n**Default Traversal Rules:**\\n\\n1.  For Convertible Objects: Only the \"elements\" and its alias \"@elements\" properties are traversed.\\n2.  For Non-Convertible Objects: All properties are traversed, with no exceptions.\\n3.  For Collections: The \"elements\" property is the only one traversed, to avoid inconsistent behavior.\\n\\nNow that we understand the default behavior, let\\'s explore how you can create custom rules using the Traversal Rule Builder. The `TraversalRule` builder provides a means to construct a set of rules for how Speckle objects should be traversed. Each rule defines which properties of a Speckle object should be traversed and predicate criteria for when the rule is active for a given Speckle object.\\n\\n`GraphTraversal.Traverse(Base)` will perform a depth-first traversal of the provided commit object, adding objects into an internal stack. Rules are executed in order for the current `Base` object. The first rule, whose predicated function holds true, determines which members of said `Base` object are traversed (added to the stack).\\n\\nThe `DefaultTraversal` contains two simple rules. A rule is triggered for convertible objects (objects either convertible directly through the converter or through the existence of a `displayValue` property). For these objects, we only traverse `\"elements\"` (and `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nThe second rule, the default rule, is used for all other objects (i.e. non-convertible objects); it traverses all properties on an object (with the exception of `Obsolete` and `SchemaIgnore` members)\\n\\n    // Implementation of the default traversal function, simplified for brevity\\n    public static GraphTraversal CreateTraverseFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n    {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(converter.CanConvertToNative) //NOTE: only one `When` clause needs to evaluate true, for this rule to hold true \\n            .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(_ => true) //Always evaluates true\\n            .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers); //AllMembers returns all non-obsolete members (instance & dynamic)\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, defaultRule);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nInside the `DefaultTraversal` class, you will find another traversal function returned by `CreateRevitTraversalFunc`. This function is almost the same as the regular function. However, instead of performing a deep traversal of nested elements. Instead, it halts traversal as soon as it finds a convertible object. Deeper traversal is then performed by the Revit converter, which has more control over the hosting of nested Revit Elements.\\n\\n      public static GraphTraversal CreateRevitTraversalFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n      {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(converter.CanConvertToNative)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(None);\\n    \\n        var displayValueRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(_ => true)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers);\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, displayValueRule, defaultRule);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-don-t-use-a-converter)\\n What if I Don’t Use a Converter?\\n\\nThese functions were designed for Speckle connectors, which by design, do not reference the `Objects` assembly. Because of this, the functions are unaware of the specific object models designed to be convertible. Thus we use the `ISpeckleConverter` interface to avoid coupling of converter and connector code projects.\\n\\nHowever, other use cases may require consuming Speckle data outside of a connector/converter’s software architecture. Fear not! the traversal functions are flexible in achieving desirable behaviour. Adapting the `CreateTraverseFunction` function or engineering custom rules to achieve the desired result is possible.\\n\\nAs a quick workaround, you could substitute the `converter.CanConvertToNative` function with a simple `b => b.speckle_type.contains(\"Objects.Geometry\")`. This should handle raw geometry, and the `HasDisplayValue` predicate should handle all other types of convertible geometry. This should give you similar results to our converter’s, though there may be some edge cases where this behaves differently.\\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-custom-traversal-behaviour)\\n What if I Want Custom Traversal Behaviour?\\n\\nThe `TraverseRule` builder can be used to create **custom rules** and custom traversal behaviour. A rule is formed by specifying a number of predicate functions and a selection function to select which property name should be traversed when the rule evaluates true.\\n\\n    bool predicateFunction(Base b) {... }\\n    IEnumerable<string> memberSelectionFunction(Base b) {... }\\n        \\n    var myCustomRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(predicateFunction)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(memberSelectionFunction);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-to-capture-custom-context)\\n What if I Want to Capture Custom Context?\\n\\nThe `TraversalContext` and `GraphTraversal` classes are designed to be subclassable. This allows developers to capture additional context such as inherited data e.g. transformation matrices, display styles, render materials, etc.\\n\\n### [#](#what-about-specklepy)\\n What About SpecklePy?\\n\\nThe same Traversal rules are coming to SpecklePy very soon. They are already being used in the Blender connector. The `GraphTraversal` and `ITraversalRule` interface works exactly the same as in Sharp. However, instead of the builder pattern, the constructor args accept `Callable` functions (e.g., regular or lambda expressions).\\n\\n    def get_default_traversal_func(can_convert_to_native: Callable[[Base], bool]) -> GraphTraversal:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Initialize traversal function for traversing a speckle commit object.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        # Rule for convertible objects\\n        convertible_rule = TraversalRule(\\n          [can_convert_to_native],\\n          lambda _: {\"elements\", \"@elements\"},\\n        )\\n    \\n        default_rule = TraversalRule(\\n          [lambda _: True],\\n          lambda o: o.get_member_names(),\\n        )\\n    \\n        return GraphTraversal([convertible_rule, default_rule])\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-about-javascript-typescrip)\\n What About Javascript/Typescrip?\\n\\nAs of now, there\\'s **no immediate plan** to bring this traversal feature to JS/TS.

It includes geometry and element base classes as well as conversions routines for the AEC applications that we officially support. Objects uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS. You can find the code in [speckle-sharp/Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nObjects is available on NuGet as `Speckle.Objects`. All converters are also available under `Speckle.Objects.COnverter.*`.\\n\\nWhile the Objects is the default kit, you are free to develop your own kit or fork this one to customise it yourself. As of the beta release, easy swapping of kits within the connectors is not fully supported. However, this will be fully supported by the time we officially ship 2.0 🎉\\n\\nMore info on Objects and kits in 2.0 can be found in our [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#developing)\\n Developing\\n----------------------------\\n\\nObjects kit is just a set of simple data transfer objects that are fairly straightforward to understand. The object model is split into two main parts:\\n\\n*   `Geometry`: the basic building blocks such as points, lines, meshes, surfaces, etc\\n*   `BuiltElements`: higher level elements such as rooms, beams, ducts, openings, topography, etc\\n\\n### [#](#writing-objects)\\n Writing Objects\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute more [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects)\\n to the Objects kit or extend and customise the kit yourself, you can easily do so by creating new classes that inherit from `Base`. You can read more about the `Base` class [here](/dev/base)\\n. There are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nThe class itself needs to have an empty constructor for serialisation / deserialisation purposes. You can create as many additional constructors for your own use as makes sense.\\n\\nFor example, here is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n### [#](#specific-host-application-support)\\n Specific Host Application Support\\n\\nThe basic objects are intended to be as general as possible\\n\\nIn order to better support interop between the various AEC host applications and Speckle, Objects also contains classes that help to deal with native object types and their properties. These inherit from a more generic Speckle object but add additional properties that are important for specific applications, but are too specific to include in the generic object.\\n\\nFor example, [`Objects.BuiltElements.Revit` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements/Revit)\\n contains a collection of classes that extend the basic ones with a series of default Revit properties. This is the approach we\\'ll follow with other host applications as well.\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-schema-information-attributes-to-classes)\\n Adding Schema Information Attributes to Classes\\n\\nIn order for these _Host Application specific_ classes to be discoverable in any other host application (such as Grasshopper\\'s `Create Schema Object` node), this objects must contain at least one constructor with the attribute `SchemaInfo`. The attribute allows to provide human-readable names and descriptions that will be used to display to the user.\\n\\nIn addition, you can optionally add the `SchemaMainParam` attribute to one of the constructor\\'s inputs to signal it as the **main geometry parameter** for that Schema.\\n\\nHere\\'s the code for the `Objects.BuiltElements.Beam` constructor, with the `baseLine` flagged as its main parameter:\\n\\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n#### [#](#handing-breaking-changes-in-the-schema-model)\\n Handing Breaking Changes in the Schema Model\\n\\nThese information from the `SchemaInfo` attribute is used, among other places, to automatically generate all the Schema Nodes you\\'ll find in the Grasshopper Connector.\\n\\nThis means that any breaking-change on that object will have unwanted side-effects on the end-user; such as previously existing Schemas dissapearing without warning.\\n\\nIn order to prevent this, the recommended way to update is to:\\n\\n1.  Add a `SchemaDeprecated` attribute to the existing constructor, and modify it\\'s implementation if necessary.\\n2.  Create a new constructor with the new parameters and add the `SchemaInfo` attribute to it too.\\n\\nFollowing our previous `Beam` example. If we added two new properties to our beam (`width` and `height`), the final changes would look like this:\\n\\n    public double width;\\n    public double height;\\n    \\n    [SchemaDeprecated, SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = 1.0;\\n        this.width = 1.0;\\n    }\\n    \\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine, double height, double width)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = height;\\n        this.width = width;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nThis will ensure that anyone using the previous Schema definition can still do, but also provide a way to notify them that they should upgrade to the new/upgraded one.\\n\\n> These `SchemaDeprecated` constructors will eventually be deleted from the object model, but not before giving all users enough warning.\\n\\n### [#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n\\nThe Objects kit doesn\\'t just stop at Objects - you need converters as well! These can be found in [Objects/Converters (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n. Each converter is a class within the `Objects.Converter` namespace and contains conversion routines to a Speckle object and to the native software equivalent. The two key methods within a converter are predictably:\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nBoth of these core methods check if the specific type passed into it is supported by the converter, then calls the conversion method for that type accordingly.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nEach supported type has its own conversion routines. You can expand the support of a converter by adding your own conversions. Depending on the converter structure, you can do this by either adding a new partial class (Revit) or adding to the respective `ConverterX.Geometry` or `ConverterX.BuiltElements` file (RhinoGh, Dynamo, AutoCAD). As a simple example, here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#instances-transforms-and-definitions)\\n Instances, Transforms, and Definitions\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle supports object instancing across many connectors, using an abstract `Objects` class that allows for conversions between block instances in Rhino and AutoCAD, family instances in Revit, collections and geometry instances in Blender, instances in Sketchup, and more.\\n\\nWhat is an instance?\\n\\nIn Speckle, an **instance** is a single **transformation** of a detached, typed **definition** object containing _transformable geometry_.\\n\\n### [#](#instances)\\n Instances\\n\\nCheck out the [Instance class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Instance.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instances live in the `Objects.Other` namespace and are comprised of two main parts:\\n\\n1.  A detached `definition` object, which contains transformable geometry including other instances.\\n2.  A `transform` matrix indicating the transformations to be applied to the geometry inside the definition.\\n\\nConcretions of the `Instance` class can contain instance-specific properties outside of the shared definition. When scoping your own concretion, keep in mind that any properties which will be shared across instances of the same definition should belong in the `definition` class, and any properties which are specific to a single instance should be on the `Instance` class.\\n\\n**What about receiving Instances in applications that do not support instancing?**\\n\\nOur abstract `Instance` class also contains virtual `GetTransformableGeometry()` and `GetTransformedGeometry()` methods which should be overridden in concretions. These methods determine how to retrieve the transformable geometry inside the `definition` and transforms their vertices with the instance transform for use in applications which do not natively support instancing.\\n\\n### [#](#transforms)\\n Transforms\\n\\nCheck out the [Transform class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Transform.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instance transformations are stored in a `System.Numerics.Matrix4x4` typed 4x4 matrix.

It\\'ll look something like the code below:\\n\\n    public class ConnectorBindingsAECApp : ConnectorBindings\\n      {\\n        public override string GetActiveViewName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<MenuItem> GetCustomStreamMenuItems()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetDocumentId()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetDocumentLocation()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetFileName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetHostAppName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<string> GetObjectsInView()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<string> GetSelectedObjects()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<ISelectionFilter> GetSelectionFilters()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<StreamState> GetStreamsInFile()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override Task<StreamState> ReceiveStream(StreamState state, ProgressViewModel progress)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override void SelectClientObjects(string args)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override Task SendStream(StreamState state, ProgressViewModel progress)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override void WriteStreamsToFile(List<StreamState> streams)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n41  \\n42  \\n43  \\n44  \\n45  \\n46  \\n47  \\n48  \\n49  \\n50  \\n51  \\n52  \\n53  \\n54  \\n55  \\n56  \\n57  \\n58  \\n59  \\n60  \\n61  \\n62  \\n63  \\n64  \\n65  \\n66  \\n67  \\n68  \\n69  \\n70  \\n71  \\n72  \\n\\nAs you might have guessed, we now need to populate these methods with logic that calls the host app API to perform the various actions. You don\\'t have to implement each method as some might not be relevant for your host application, but make sure exceptions are handled gracefully.

We encourage everyone adding it (and enabling it) in their connectors. The more usage we see, the more resources the project will get and a Better Speckle will be possible.\\n\\nThe telemetry service (matomo) is already added as a reference in Core, so you will just need to:\\n\\n*   initialize it with a `Setup.Init()` with the name of your connector as input, [example (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/2a2ac0a6900e8833081b8cc851878b0decffa304/ConnectorGrasshopper/ConnectorGrasshopper/Loader.cs#L25)\\n    .\\n*   track the [main actions (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Core/Core/Logging/Tracker.cs#L20-L48)\\n     with `Tracker.TrackPageView`, [example (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/2a2ac0a6900e8833081b8cc851878b0decffa304/ConnectorGrasshopper/ConnectorGrasshopper/Ops/Operations.SendComponent.cs#L59)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#writing-the-converter)\\n Writing the Converter\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLast crucial bit for your connector to work properly is to create a converter.

So if your converter is built as `Objects.Converter.Tekla.dll` , the method should return `new string[] { \"Tekla\"};`\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to add your `APP_NAME` to the [list of applications in Core (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/Applications.cs)\\n, we can certainly do so, just submit a PR.\\n\\n### [#](#the-context-document)\\n The Context Document\\n\\nThe `SetContextDocument` is used to _inject_ the Document from the connector and host app API to the converter ( it might have a different name in your case, or not even exist!), but in software as Revit or Rhino it\\'s fundamental to create new objects, start transactions, get units etc...\\n\\n### [#](#the-convert-methods)\\n The Convert methods\\n\\nThe most important methods in a converter are `ConvertToNative` and `ConvertToSpeckle`, and are what will take most of your time and API flexing skills.\\n\\nPlease have a look at how things are done in other converters, you will most likely end up having a switch statement with a list of functions that handle the various geometry and data types.\\n\\nThe logic of these routines can get quite complicated if you want to support nested elements or update previously received objects, and we recommend adding such functionalities later.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to properly set the units of your objects when sending to Speckle and to scale incoming geometry when receiving from Speckle.\\n\\nFor any questions feel free to write on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n!\\n\\n### [#](#new-objects)\\n New Objects\\n\\nIf the host app you\\'re targeting uses object types not currently defined in the Objects kit and you\\'d like to write conversions for them, we are happy to extend it!\\n\\nPlease get in touch on the forum before making a PR, then have a look at [how to write new objects](/dev/objects.html#writing-objects)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#loading-the-converter)\\n Loading the Converter\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt some point in your `ConnectorBindings` you\\'ll need to implement the `SendStream` and `ReceiveStream` methods. It\\'s within these that we will be invoking methods of the converter and then either send or receive data to/from Speckle.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThe connector **should never have a direct references** to the converter or kit. This is because kits are swappable and having a direct reference would prevent this mechanism from working.\\n\\nTo invoke the `ConvertToNative` and `ConvertToSpeckle` methods (and other methods / properties as well) of the converter, we first need to load it. To do so, you should use the `KitManager` in `Core` as follows:\\n\\n    var kit = KitManager.GetDefaultKit();\\n    var converter = kit.LoadConverter(APP_NAME);\\n    // then stuff like converter.ConvertToNative(obj);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\nThe converter, as you might have seen above should have implemented other handy methods such as `CanConvertToSpeckle`\\n\\nFor more information on how to implement the send/receive bindings, use our connectors\\' implementations as reference, and (for receive) see [Traversal docs](/dev/traversal.html)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#publishing-the-connector)\\n Publishing the Connector\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe currently don\\'t have mechanisms to publish third party connectors via Manager, but if you\\'d like to do so please write on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n and we\\'ll work out a solution!

As mentioned in [this page](/dev/kits)\\n, kits are made of:\\n\\n*   an object model\\n*   a set of converters\\n\\nA good example is the Objects kit, in our [speckle-sharp repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\n[#](#object-model)\\n Object Model\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAn Object Model is just a collection _data structures_. These are the types that the kit is supporting, and for which conversion routines need to be written so that you can send and receive from Speckle.\\n\\n### [#](#creating-an-object-model)\\n Creating an Object Model\\n\\nThere are a few general rules to keep in mind when writing these classes.\\n\\n#### [#](#_1-always-inherit-from-the-base-class)\\n 1. Always Inherit from the `Base` Class\\n\\nThis ensures serialisation and deserialisation happen through Speckle, with the default sane serialisation handling that we know we can support. Most importantly, it will enable type name handling and cross-kit legibility. For more on the `Base` class, head to the [Base Object](/dev/base)\\n section.\\n\\n#### [#](#_2-reference-loops-will-be-ignored)\\n 2. Reference Loops will be Ignored\\n\\nYou can always recreate them post deserialisation using a function flagged with the `[OnDeserialized]` attribute like so:\\n\\n      [OnDeserialized]\\n      internal void onDeserialized(StreamingContext context)\\n      {\\n        Edges.ForEach(e => e.Brep = this);\\n        Loops.ForEach(l => l.Brep = this);\\n        Trims.ForEach(t => t.Brep = this);\\n        Faces.ForEach(f => f.Brep = this);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n#### [#](#_3-keep-data-structures-lean)\\n 3. Keep Data Structures Lean\\n\\nYou should prefer typed arrays over lists of non-primitive values. For example, instead of a `List<Point>` for keeping track of mesh vertices, use a `List<double>`\\n\\n#### [#](#_4-always-include-a-parameterless-constructor)\\n 4. Always Include a Parameterless Constructor\\n\\nThis is for Newtonsoft serialisation / deserialisation. At worst, flag one constructor with the `[JsonConstructor]` attribute. Keep in mind this does indirect magic that can potentially trip you up - eg key names must match argument prop names.\\n\\n### [#](#example)\\n Example\\n\\nWith these rules in mind, creating your own classes by inheriting from `Base` is relatively straight forward. Additionally, there are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nFor a simple example, this is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n[#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n----------------------------\\n\\nConverters are the key to interoperability. They include the conversion routines for objects to and from the object model types. You create a new converter for each different application you want to support by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleConverter` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleConverter.cs)\\n. All your converters should live together in the same kit alongside your types. You can see how we\\'ve implemented converters in our default Objects kit [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n.\\n\\nConverters exist in the `MyKit.Converter` namespace and can either be broken up into smaller partial classes for each supported type (see the Revit Converter) or for each category (eg `ConverterX.Geometry` and `ConverterX.BuiltElements` as in the rest of our converters).\\n\\nThe converters must implement two key methods (plus a few others not described here):\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nThe specific conversion routines for each supported type are defined separately and called from these key methods. If the type is not supported, an error should be added to the converter\\'s `ConversionErrors` and a null object should be returned.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nAnd here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kit-interface)\\n Kit Interface\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got your object model and your conversion routines, you can officially put together your kit by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleKit` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleKit.cs)\\n and register your `Types` and `Converters`.\\n\\n    public interface ISpeckleKit\\n    {\\n      IEnumerable<Type> Types { get; }\\n    \\n      IEnumerable<string> Converters { get; }\\n    \\n      string Description { get; }\\n      string Name { get; }\\n      string Author { get; }\\n      string WebsiteOrEmail { get; }\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Tries to load a converter for a specific app.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"app\">Must be one of the Kits.Applications variables.</param>\\n      /// <returns>The converter for the specific app, or null.</returns>\\n      public ISpeckleConverter LoadConverter(string app);\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kitmanager)\\n KitManager\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe KitManager is a handy tool for loading up different kits.

This allows you, as a developer, to even use Speckle \"without Speckle\".\\n\\nWe currently have a couple of transports scaffolded:\\n\\n*   in memory\\n*   sqlite\\n*   disk\\n*   remote (speckle server)\\n*   mongodb (experimental)\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports are available on NuGet as `Speckle.Transports.*`.\\n\\nWhy are transports really cool? Imagine you want to write your own server, from scratch. To use it in all our connectors, the only thing you need to do is write a transport that uses your server\\'s api!\\n\\nAnother use case would be if you want to simultaneously send your data to a MySQL database. We currently do not support this, but using a custom built transport, you can send your data to it, at the same time as sending it to a Speckle server.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nWhere are all the transports?\\n\\n*   Required ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Core/Transports)\\n     (in-memory, sqlite)\\n*   Extraneous ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Transports)\\n     (Server, Disk, MongoDB)\\n\\nHere\\'s how the `ITransport` interface looks like.

To use the client, you\\'ll need access to a Speckle server. To authenticate the client, you\\'ll either need local accounts (added using [Manager](/user/manager)\\n), or you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    \\n    # initialise the client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    # authenticate the client with a token\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # if you\\'re in an environment without accounts, you can construct an Account object yourself\\n    # or authenticate with just a token\\n    # client.authenticate_with_token(\"YOUR_TOKEN\")\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nNow that you have an authenticated client, you can start interacting with the API. Let\\'s create a new stream and get that stream back.\\n\\n    # create a new stream. this returns the stream id\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # use that stream id to get the stream from the server\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nNext, we\\'ll need some data to send. Let\\'s extend `Base` to create a simple block to make it more interesting. All your custom objects should inherit from `Base` to ensure that serialization will work as expected.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point\\n    \\n    class Block(Base):\\n        length: float\\n        width: float\\n        height: float\\n        origin: Point = None\\n    \\n        def __init__(self, length=1.0, width=1.0, height=1.0, origin=Point(), **kwargs) -> None:\\n            super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n            # mark the origin as a detachable attribute\\n            self.add_detachable_attrs({\"origin\"})\\n    \\n            self.length = length\\n            self.width = width\\n            self.height = height\\n            self.origin = origin\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNow let\\'s send a block to the server! To do this, you\\'ll first need to send the object to the stream and get back the object id or hash. You can then use this to create a commit on the stream that references this object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    # here\\'s the data you want to send\\n    block = Block(length=2, height=4)\\n    \\n    # next create a server transport - this is the vehicle through which you will send and receive\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n    # this serialises the block and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=block, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # you can now create a commit on your stream with this object\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        stream_id=new_stream_id, \\n        object_id=hash, \\n        message=\"this is a block I made in speckle-py\",\\n        )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nTada! You should now have a commit on your stream containing your block. You\\'ll be able to see the commit on the stream page on the web. Receiving an object back is pretty similar to receiving it. You\\'ll generally be using the client to get a commit, then getting the hash to receive from the `referencedObject` attribute on that commit.\\n\\n    # this receives the object back from the transport.\\n    # the received data will be deserialised back into a `Block` \\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#short-hand-the-stream-wrapper)\\n Short Hand: The Stream Wrapper\\n\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to simply send and receive objects using the `SpeckleClient` and a `ServerTransport`. Since v2.2.6, you can use a handy helper to get a client and a transport from a stream URL - the `StreamWrapper`!\\n\\nThe `StreamWrapper` can parse any URL pointing to a stream, branch, commit, object, or globals. If you have a local account for the stream you provided, you can get an authenticated client and transport using the helper methods:\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.wrapper import StreamWrapper\\n    \\n    # provide any stream, branch, commit, object, or globals url\\n    wrapper = StreamWrapper(\"https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/commits/604bea8cc6\")\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated SpeckleClient if you have a local account for the server\\n    client = wrapper.get_client()\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated ServerTransport if you have a local account for the server\\n    transport = wrapper.get_transport()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#overview-of-functionality)\\n Overview of Functionality\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#graphql-client)\\n GraphQL Client\\n\\nThe `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API. You\\'ll need to have access to a speckle server to use this. To authenticate, you\\'ll need a token. You can either get one from an account you\\'ve already added to your computer using the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n, or you can head to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account, get_local_accounts\\n    \\n    all_accounts = get_local_accounts() # get back a list\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    \\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nInteracting with streams is designed to be intuitive and evocative of SpecklePy 1.0\\n\\n    # get a list of your most recent streams\\n    stream_list = client.stream.list()\\n    \\n    # search your streams\\n    results = client.stream.search(\"mech\")\\n    \\n    # create a stream\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # get a stream\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nNew in 2.0: branches and commits!

You will need to provide a `transport` to indicate where the objects should be sent to/received from. When sending, you can provide multiple transports to send the same object to multiple places simultaneously. Currently, we have three types of \\'transport\\': `SQLiteTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, and `ServerTransport`. If you\\'d like to learn more about Transports in Speckle 2.0, have a look [here](/dev/transports)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.memory import MemoryTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    transport = MemoryTransport()\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # this serialises the object and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=base_obj, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # if the object had detached objects, you can see these as well\\n    saved_objects = transport.objects # a dict with the obj hash as the key\\n    \\n    # this receives an object from the given transport, deserialises it,\\n    # and recomposes it into a base object.\\n    # you can optionally provide a local_transport which will default to\\n    # the `SQLiteTransport` pointing at your local cache\\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nYou can also use the GraphQL API to send and receive objects. However, note that this method will not recompose a base and will only get the object you explicitly ask for using by its id.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer\\n    \\n    # create a test base object\\n    test_base = Base()\\n    test_base.testing = \"a test base obj\"\\n    \\n    # run it through the serialiser\\n    s = BaseObjectSerializer()\\n    hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)\\n    \\n    # send it to the server\\n    objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id=\"stream id\", objects=[obj])\\n    \\n    received_base = client.object.get(\"stream id\", hash)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\n### [#](#base-object-and-serialization)\\n Base Object and Serialization\\n\\n#### [#](#the-base-object)\\n The Base Object\\n\\nThe `Base` class is the one you\\'re familiar with from the rest of the Speckle universe. It generally behaves the same way as it does in the other SDKs. For more info about the `Base` object, have a look [here](/dev/base)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # creating a base we will nest within a parent base\\n    detached_base = Base()\\n    detached_base.name = \"a detached base\"\\n    \\n    # creating our parent base object\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # attributes can be added using dot or dict notation\\n    base_obj.name = \"my base\"\\n    base_obj[\"colour\"] = \"lilac\"\\n    \\n    # other base objects can be nested within.\\n    # prepending the attribute name with `@` will detach the nested base when sending\\n    base_obj[\"@nested\"] = detached_base\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\nThe `Base` class has a few handy instance methods for identifying your object\\'s typed and dynamic attributes:\\n\\n*   `get_typed_member_names()` gets all of the names of the defined (typed) attributes of the object\\n*   `get_dynamic_member_names()` gets all of the names of the dynamic attributes of the object\\n*   `get_member_names()` gets a list of all the attributes on the object, dynamic or not\\n\\nEach `Base` object has an `id` (a unique hash) as it does in the other SDKs. This field is only populated if the `Base` has been previously serialized. If you _really_ need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.\\n\\n#### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nThe `Base` class can be subclassed to create your own custom objects. These are automatically added to a class-level registry, simply a dictionary with the type name as the key. The type is automatically populated by the `speckle_type` attribute but can be overwritten when writing your class.\\n\\nNote that all typed attributes of a class **must be initialized with a non-mutable default value** or a value that you will only change by reassignment.

You probably won\\'t ever need to use it directly. However, if you want, you can use it to get the id (hash) and a serializable object representation of the decomposed `Base`.

We\\'ll be receiving geometry from a stream, updating the data, and using it to do some calculations and simple plots using Plotly and Dash.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\nWe will assume you have general knowledge of Python and Speckle. If anything trips you up, have a look back at the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n or the [Speckle Concepts](/user/concepts)\\n.\\n\\nIf you want to follow along with the code, the repo for this project can be found [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/izzylys/demo-specklepy)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#receive-objects-from-the-server)\\n Receive Objects from the Server\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'ve already been through the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n, you\\'ll already know how to receive objects from the server. As a refresher, you\\'ll need to create a `SpeckleClient` which serves as your entry point to the API. We then authenticate this client using a token from a local account. If you haven\\'t used the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n to add a local account, you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token to use here. We\\'ll then use this client to get the commit we\\'re interested in.\\n\\nIn this case, we\\'re going to be looking at this twisty building Alan generated in Grasshopper and send to Speckle using the [Grasshopper Connector](/user/grasshopper)\\n. It has 10 levels split into separate objects each containing fields for facades, columns, banisters, and floor slabs.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-gh-commit.4e610fcb.gif)\\n\\nThe snippet below shows how you would authenticate the client, get the commit we\\'re interested in, and use a server transport to receive the commit object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    \\n    # create and authenticate a client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # get the specified commit data\\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    # create an authenticated server transport from the client and receive the commit obj\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#update-existing-objects)\\n Update Existing Objects\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve received this building from Grasshopper, let\\'s make some modifications. The data has already been structured nicely into a list of `Base` objects each representing a level. Each level has attributes containing that level\\'s facade, columns, banister, and floor slab.\\n\\n    {\\n        \"id\":  \"idfcaf8b9e145241dsdfa915885d87cda2\",\\n        \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\n        \"data\": [\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                \"id\":  \"ide6acabd37e865ce87a5sdf444d733877\",\\\\\\n                \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\\\\\n                \"@facade\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@columns\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@banister\": { ... },\\\\\\n                \"@floorSlab\": { ... }\\\\\\n            },\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                ...\\\\\\n            }\\\\\\n        ]\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nLet\\'s say we want to do some estimated embodied carbon calculations. However, currently no material information has been added to the elements in the stream. We can add this ourselves and update the stream for the rest of the team.\\n\\n### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nTo do this, let\\'s create classes for each material and add these materials to a \"material\" attribute on each object within the stream. Obviously, this is a bit of an over the top example. It would be more efficient to just add a string attribute to each object that indicates the material, then look up the material properties from a database when running the calculations. However, I want to have some fun here and show you some of the cool things you can do with the `Base` class!\\n\\nLet\\'s start with defining our materials as `Base` subclasses. This ensures they\\'ll be serialised correctly and that they\\'ll be picked up by the `Base` type registry. We can then create a mapping for each element type name to the `speckle_type` of the corresponding material class. The `speckle_type` is prepopulated by the class and defaults to the class name.\\n\\n    # density (kg/m^3) and embodied carbon (kg CO^2/kg) estimates\\n    # from https://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/embodied-energy/\\n    class Concrete(Base):\\n        density: str = 2400\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.159\\n    \\n    \\n    class Glass(Base):\\n        density: str = 2500\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.85\\n    \\n    \\n    class Steel(Base):\\n        density: str = 7800\\n        embodied_carbon = 1.37\\n    \\n    \\n    MATERIALS_MAPPING = {\\n        \"@floorSlab\": \"Concrete\",\\n        \"@banister\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@facade\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@columns\": \"Steel\",\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nWe can now write a function that iterates through all the members of a level and adds a material if it exists in our mapping.\\n\\n    def add_materials_data(level: Base) -> Base:\\n        # first, get all the attribute names\\n        names = level.get_member_names()\\n        # then iterate through them to check if they exist in our mapping\\n        for name in names:\\n            if name not in MATERIALS_MAPPING.keys():\\n                break\\n            # if they do, use this class method to get the class and init it\\n            material = Base.get_registered_type(MATERIALS_MAPPING[name])()\\n            # now we can add a `@material` attribute dynamically to each object.\\n            # note that we\\'re making it detachable with the `@`\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                prop[\"@material\"] = material\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                for item in prop:\\n                    item[\"@material\"] = material\\n        return level\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNote that we\\'ve added a _detached_ dynamic attribute called `@material` to each element we are interested in. We\\'ve marked it as detachable (prepended with an `@`) so we don\\'t store hundreds of copies of the same materials classes in this stream. Each instance of each materials class in our case is the same, so we only need to store each once. However, we want to reference them within multiple elements. Using a detachable attribute is the solution! You get a reference for the correct material object in each element, but you only store unique objects (in our case, one instance of each material class) in the stream.\\n\\n### [#](#sending-to-the-stream)\\n Sending to the Stream\\n\\nWe can now use the `add_materials_data()` method we wrote to update all the levels in the stream and send these updated levels back. Let\\'s add on to what we\\'ve already written.\\n\\nTo send our updated building, we\\'ll need to create a parent `Base` and place our list of nested levels inside this parent. To keep things consistent, we\\'ll be adding them to a field called `data`.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nWe\\'ll then use `operations.send()` to send this object to the stream, then use `client.commit.create()` to commit our changes to the stream. If we want to send to a new branch, we can do so by first creating one using `client.branch.create(stream_id, name, description)`. The snippet below shows this full process.\\n\\n    # recap from earlier\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a branch if you\\'d like\\n    branch_name = \"🐍 demo\"\\n    branches = client.branch.list(STREAM_ID)\\n    has_res_branch = any(b.name == branch_name for b in branches)\\n    if not has_res_branch:\\n        client.branch.create(\\n            STREAM_ID, name=branch_name, description=\"new stuff from py\"\\n        )\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    # and send the data to the server and get back the hash of the object\\n    obj_id = operations.send(base, [transport])\\n    \\n    # now create a commit on that branch with your updated data!\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        STREAM_ID,\\n        obj_id,\\n        branch_name,\\n        message=\"add detached materials\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n\\nIf we go back to the web to look at the stream, you\\'ll see your newest commit. The geometry should look the same since this hasn\\'t been modified, but stepping into the data will show you the new material attribute. As you can see in the gif below, the id of the `Concrete` object is the same on different floor slabs since the attribute is detached and the objects are identical.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-materials-data.dee7f66f.gif)\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve sent your changes to the server, anyone you\\'re collaborating with will also be able to pull down your changes and use these updated elements with materials data!\\n\\n[#](#do-cool-stuff)\\n Do Cool Stuff\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve now seen how we can receive, work with, and send data from Python just like you can with any of the other SDKs and connectors. Great, now we can use that data to make something cool! Let\\'s plot the data using [plotly (opens new window)](https://plotly.com/python/)\\n and display it on a simple page using [dash (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n. I won\\'t go into too much detail on using the libraries themselves, but most of the plotting code has just been modified from the boilerplate and examples in their docs.\\n\\nTo start, let\\'s extract some existing data from the objects and plot them. Each geometry object we\\'re interested in has a `Vertices` attribute containing a list of points. Let\\'s plot the vertices of the floor slabs and columns on a 3D scatter plot. To do this, we\\'ll need to construct a pandas data frame with the values we are interested in by iterating through the levels.\\n\\n    import pandas as pd\\n    \\n    def construct_points_df(levels: List[Base]):\\n        # initialise a pandas data frame\\n        df_vertices = pd.DataFrame(columns=(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"element\"))\\n    \\n        vertices = []\\n        for level in levels:\\n            # add column vertices\\n            columns = level[\"@columns\"]\\n            for column in columns:\\n                points = column.Vertices\\n                for p in points:\\n                    vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"columns\"})\\n            # add floor slab vertices\\n            floorslab = level[\"@floorSlab\"]\\n            points = floorslab.Vertices\\n            for p in points:\\n                vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"floorSlab\"})\\n    \\n        return df_vertices.append(vertices)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nNow we can just pass that data frame into the plotly express `scatter_3d` method and `show()` the figure.\\n\\n    import plotly.express as px\\n    \\n    df_vertices = construct_points_df(levels)\\n    \\n    fig = px.scatter_3d(\\n        df_vertices,\\n        x=\"x\",\\n        y=\"y\",\\n        z=\"z\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        opacity=0.7,\\n        title=\"Element Vertices (m)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    fig.show()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\nPlotly plots have interactivity built in, so this is all the code we need to produce this 3D scatter plot.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VGcrHPB.gif)\\n\\nNext, let\\'s make use of the material properties we added to each of the stream objects. Let\\'s calculate the mass and embodied carbon for each element type in one level and construct a data frame with the results.\\n\\n    def construct_carbon_df(level: Base):\\n        data = {\"element\": [], \"volume\": [], \"mass\": [], \"embodied carbon\": []}\\n    \\n        # get the attributes on the level object\\n        names = level.get_dynamic_member_names()\\n        # iterate through and find the elements with a `volume` attribute\\n        for name in names:\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                if not hasattr(prop, \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                # if it has a volume, use the material attribute to calculated\\n                # the embodied carbon\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(prop.volume)\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                if not hasattr(prop[0], \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(sum(p.volume for p in prop))\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            data[\"element\"].append(name[1:]) # removing the prepending `@`\\n    \\n        return pd.DataFrame(data)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nUsing this data frame, we can use the plotly express `pie()` and `bar()` methods to create some lovely plots.\\n\\n    # take the first level from our levels list and construct a data frame\\n    df_carbon = construct_carbon_df(levels[0])\\n    \\n    # let\\'s add them all to a dict to keep the together\\n    figures = {}\\n    \\n    figures[\"volumes\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"volume\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Volumes of Elements Per Floor (m3)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon bar\"] = px.bar(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        x=\"element\",\\n        y=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon pie\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nThe last thing we\\'re going to do is add the figures to a dash app. To do this, we are simply taking the boilerplate [dash layout (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n, replacing the sample figure with our own figures, and adding some custom css in `/assets/style.css`.\\n\\n// Make sure to add code blocks to your code group\\n\\nNow all that\\'s left is to run `app.py` and head to [`http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (opens new window)](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)\\n to see your amazing plots.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\n[#](#conclusion)\\n Conclusion\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAnd voila - you\\'ve created the basis for a dashboard powered by your Speckle data!

The examples assume a Viewer instance named `v`.\\n\\n### [#](#load-unload-an-object)\\n Load/Unload an Object\\n\\n`v.loadObject( objectUrl )` / `v.unloadObject( objectUrl )`\\n\\nExample: `v.loadObject( 'https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/objects/e05c5834368931c9d9a4e2087b4da670' )`\\n\\n### [#](#get-properties-of-loaded-objects)\\n Get Properties of Loaded Objects\\n\\n`v.getObjectsProperties()`\\n\\nThis returns a dictionary with `{ propertyName: propertyInfo }` elements. The property information provided is:\\n\\n*   `type` ( == `'string'` / `'number'` / `'boolean'`): the property type\\n*   `objectCount` (int): How many objects in the scene have this property\\n*   `allValues` (array of `objectCount` elements): The values for this property of all objects that have this property\\n*   `minValue` - the smallest value (using `<` operator, works also on strings)\\n*   `maxValue` - the largest value\\n*   `uniqueValues` - a dictionary of `{ uniqueValue: occurrenceCount }` elements, specifying how many objects have the property set to that specific value\\n\\n### [#](#filtering-and-colouring)\\n Filtering and Colouring\\n\\nThose calls filter and color the objects loaded in the scene, and drops the previous applied filters (filtering is not additive).\\n\\nSyntax: `await v.applyFilter( { filterBy, colorBy, ghostOthers } )`\\n\\nThe 3 optional parameters are:\\n\\n*   `filterBy`: A dictionary that specify the filter. Elements are in the form `{ propertyName: propertyValueFilter }`. The propertyValueFilter can be one of:\\n    \\n    *   A specific value: (only objects with that property value pass the filter)\\n    *   An array of values: An object passes the filter if its value is in the array\\n    *   A range of values, specified by `{ 'gte': value1, 'lte': value2 }` (greater than or equal, lower than or equal)\\n    *   An exclusion list, specified by `{ 'not': excludedValuesArray }`\\n*   `colorBy`: A dictionary that makes all objects colored based on a property value. Two types of coloring are supported:\\n    \\n    *   Gradient (from a numeric property): `{ 'type': 'gradient', 'property': propertyName, 'minValue': propertyMinValue, 'maxValue': propertyMaxValue, 'gradientColors': [color1, color2] }`\\n    *   Category (for coloring each unique value differently): `{ 'type': 'category', 'property': propertyName, 'values': { value1: color1, value2: color2, ... }, 'default': colorForAnyOtherValue }`. The `values` and the `default` parameters are optional: Random colors are generated if they are omitted.\\n*   `ghostOthers`: A boolean (default `false`).

With just a few lines of code, you\\'ll be able to send, receive and leverage our API from Google Sheets, Docs etc.\\n\\nHere\\'s a few examples to get you started.\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nFirst of all we need to create a [Personal Access Token](/dev/tokens)\\n, make sure to select the scopes that you\\'ll need for running your queries and mutations. As always, treat this token as a password!\\n\\n[#](#writing-your-queries)\\n Writing your Queries\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo learn how to write queries check out our section on the [Server API](/dev/server-api)\\n, and use the GraphQL explorer to make sure your query or mutation works as expected.\\n\\nNext, since App Scripts doesn\\'t have a GraphQL library we need to transform them a bit to work with `UrlFetchApp`, it\\'s just a matter of setting the right payload and parameters.\\n\\nHere\\'s what a function that runs a query to get the currently logged user looks like, remember to replace `YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN`. You can extend its fields to get the streams, branches and commits as well:\\n\\n    function getMe() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `query User {\\n                          user{\\n                            id,\\n                            email,\\n                            name\\n                          }\\n                        }`,\\n        variables: null,\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n\\nTIP\\n\\nHow do you create a token, we hear you ask? Read the section on [personal access tokens](/dev/tokens.html)\\n!\\n\\nHere\\'s a function that runs a mutation to create a new stream:\\n\\n    function createStream() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `mutation streamCreate($myStream: StreamCreateInput!) { streamCreate(stream: $myStream) }`,\\n        variables: {\\n          myStream: {\\n            name: \"Sample Stream\",\\n            description: \"Created from Google Sheets!\",\\n          },\\n        },\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nThis is all!

You can then use this to trigger ci apps, automation workflows, and more! The world is your oyster. Let\\'s have a quick look at how to work with them.\\n\\n[#](#setting-up-a-stream-webhook)\\n Setting Up A Stream Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOn the sidebar of a stream, you\\'ll find a \"⚙ Settings\" button. Click this and head to the \"Webhooks\" tab to add webhooks to your stream.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126977638-67d2958c-12d2-40b2-aef3-da5a01451773.gif)\\n\\nThere are a few different fields to fill out when setting up a webhook:\\n\\n*   URL: The URL that will be sent `POST` requests when your webhook is triggered\\n*   Description: Optional identifying text (will be shown when viewing all your webhooks in a list)\\n*   Secret: An optional token that will help you verity that requests you receive are actually coming from the Speckle Server. Requests will be secured with an `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` which you can verify upon receiving.\\n*   Triggers: The events you want to trigger the webhook\\n*   Enabled: Toggle the webhook on and off\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126979041-ac01d1f7-e9d3-455c-ab4f-7154ab891a96.png)\\n\\nYou can of course also manage webhooks via the [GraphQL API](/dev/server-graphql-api)\\n using the `webhookCreate`, `webhookUpdate`, and `webhookDelete` mutations. There is a `webhooks` field on the `stream` schema which you can query to get the webhooks for a stream and the `history` of previous requests.\\n\\n[#](#receiving-the-webhook)\\n Receiving the Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen the condition defined in the webhook definition is met, a `POST` request will be made to the provided URL.\\n\\nThe POST request will contain 1 string parameter, called `payload`, that is the JSON representation of the webhook payload.\\n\\nImportant note on the JSON encoding\\n\\nThe way of passing the POST parameter is `application/json`, and the parameter is again encoded as JSON for compatibility with various frameworks that don\\'t handle nested json properties. So the actual POST request body might look something like:\\n\\n    {\"payload\":\"{\\\\\"streamId\\\\\":\\\\\"a35c7a8bdd\\\\\",\\\\\"userId\\\\\":\\\\\"bc4e472126\\\\\",\\\\\"activityMessage\\\\\":\\\\\"Stream metadata changed\\\\\", ...\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nTo ensure that only the configured Speckle Server will successfully call your publicly available webhook server, there is the `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` header that can be used to validate the authenticity of the call. It is the sha256 HMAC on the payload json string, using the shared secret configured on the webhook. Example python code to validate the signature:\\n\\n    import hmac\\n    # ...\\n    \\n    expected_signature = hmac.new(SHARED_SECRET.encode(), payload_json.encode(), \\'sha256\\').hexdigest()\\n    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, SIGNATURE_FROM_HEADER):\\n        print(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n        return\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nAnd javascript (node):\\n\\n    const * as crypto from \\'crypto\\'\\n    \\n    const secret = \\'YOUR_SECRET_HERE\\'\\n    const expectedSignature = crypto\\n        .createHmac(\\'sha256\\', secret)\\n        .update(request.body.payload)\\n        .digest(\\'hex\\')\\n    const signatureFromHeader = request.headers[\\'x-webhook-signature\\']\\n    \\n    if (signatureFromHeader != expectedSignature) response.status(401).send(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#reporting-success)\\n Reporting Success\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe endpoint code should return a HTTP response status header. The server recognises statuses `200 OK` to `204 NO_CONTENT` as a successful execution. Alternatively, your endpoint can respond with other statuses in its execution. The webhook execution log shows these as error with additional payload data you supply to diagnose issues.\\n\\nGo back to the main \"Webhooks\" tab to view all the webhooks on the stream. Click on a webhook to open the edit menu. The symbol to the left to the description indicates the status of the last webhook request; hover over it to get more information. Here, the green ✔ indicates the last request was successfully sent. The grey circle with an ❕ indicates no requests have been sent yet (you\\'ve likely just created the webhook and none of the triggers have happened yet).

This has security implications too.\\n*   database backups: again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability. Cloud providers can provide horizontal VM auto-scaling and Kubernetes can provide horizontal pod auto-scaling but these are not discussed in this guide.\\n*   monitoring: this setup does not describe integrations for telemetry, metrics, tracing, or logging. Nor does it describe alerting or response actions.\\n*   firewall and network hardening: running in production requires additional security hardening measures, particularly protecting the network from intrusion or data exfiltration.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n*   \\\\[Required\\\\] A [DigitalOcean (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\\n     account.

We provided the cluster a name, but otherwise left configuration as per DigitalOcean\\'s recommended defaults. When prompted to select the node count and size, we selected four nodes. Each node has the default 2 vcpu and 4Gb (`s-2vcpu-4gb`). While this is a minimum, your usage may vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by deploying new nodes or larger sized machines in new node-pools. ![](/assets/img/01_select_node_size.07d7fdb8.png)\\n    \\n*   Configure other options for your Kubernetes cluster and click the `Create Cluster` button. After the cluster is created and initialized, you should see it in your list of kubernetes clusters: ![](/assets/img/02_kubernetes_clusters.21c632ca.png)\\n    \\n*   To log into the cluster, follow the getting started guide on the DigitalOcean dashboard for your cluster. We recommend the automated option of updating your local Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) using the [DigitalOcean client, `doctl` (opens new window)](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)\\n    . ![](/assets/img/03_get_kubeconfig.44d3076f.png)\\n    \\n*   After downloading the kubernetes config, you can verify that your kubernetes client has the cluster configuration by running the following command. A list of kubernetes clusters will be printed, your cluster context should have the prefix `do-`. Make a note of the name, you will use this in place of `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` in most of the following steps of this guide.\\n    \\n\\n    kubectl config get-contexts\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/04_show_contexts.5ec3c519.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl by running the following command to show the nodes you have provisioned.

Go to the [new Database creation page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new)\\n    . Firstly, select the same region and VPC as you used when deploying your Kubernetes cluster, and select Redis. Provide a name, and click `Create Database Cluster`.

You can provide your own if you have an existing blob storage which is compatible with the [Amazon S3 API (opens new window)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)\\n. Otherwise follow the following steps to create a new S3-compatible blob storage on DigitalOcean.\\n\\n*   Navigate to the [Create a Space page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/new)\\n    . Please select a region of your choice, we recommend the same region as you have deployed the cluster. We did not enable the CDN and we restricted the file listing for security purposes. Please provide a name for your Space, this has to be unique in the region so please use a different name than our example. Make a note of this name, this is the `bucket` value which we will require when configuring your deployment in [step 4](#step-4-configure-your-deployment)\\n    . Click on `Create Space`. ![](/assets/img/12_blob_storage_configuration.b77b8f17.png)\\n    \\n*   Once created, click on the `Settings` tab and copy the `Endpoint` value. ![](/assets/img/13_spaces_endpoint.1ed95325.png)\\n    \\n*   Now navigate to the [API page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)\\n     in DigitalOcean.

We can create a namespace in our Kubernetes cluster with the following command. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n\\n    kubectl create namespace speckle --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/15_create_namespace.a9e6faa4.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that the namespace was created by running the following command. You should see a list of namespaces, including `speckle`. The other existing namespaces were created by Kubernetes and are required for Kubernetes to run. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.\\n\\n    kubectl get namespace --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/16_get_namespaces.39b228b4.png)\\n\\n### [#](#step-3-b-create-secrets)\\n Step 3.b: Create Secrets\\n\\n*   To securely store the connection details of Speckle\\'s dependencies, we will create a secret in the Kubernetes Cluster in the `speckle` namespace. Replace all the items starting with `${YOUR_...}` with the appropriate value. `${YOUR_SECRET}` should be replaced with a value unique to this cluster, we recommend creating a random value of at least 10 characters long.\\n\\n    kubectl create secret generic server-vars \\\\\\n     --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\" \\\\\\n     --namespace speckle \\\\\\n     --from-literal=redis_url=\"${YOUR_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=postgres_url=\"${YOUR_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=s3_secret_key=\"${YOUR_SPACES_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=session_secret=\"${YOUR_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=email_password=\"${YOUR_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD}\" # optional, only required if you wish to enable email invitations\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n*   You can verify that your secret was created correctly by running the following command.

This will allow web browser\\'s to resolve your domain name to the IP of the load balancer. The domain must match the domain name provided to Speckle in the `values.yaml` file you edited previously. If DigitalOcean manages your Domain Names, adding a DNS A record using \\\\[DigitalOcean\\'s Domain page(https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains) will look something like the following: ![](/assets/img/32_domain_a_record.74fb0b6b.png)\\\\\\n    \\\\\\n*   It may take a moment for the domain name and A Record to be propagated to all relevant DNS servers, and then for Let\\'s Encrypt to be able to reach your domain and generate a certificate.

This guide provides details on how to do that.\\n*   If you want to deploy the Server with your own modifications, you should build your own docker images. Please refer to our separate guide on [local development](./server-local-dev)\\n    .\\n\\n[#](#dependencies)\\n Dependencies\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe Speckle server needs these services available over the network:\\n\\n*   PostgreSQL (tested with v12 and v13)\\n*   Redis\\n*   Optional: S3-compatible Object Storage\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nPostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO are included in the following deployment instructions, so **you don\\'t need to install them manually**.\\n\\nYou can also install them manually or use a managed deployment from a cloud provider (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc). Setting them up manually is out of scope of this article.\\n\\n[#](#run-in-a-virtual-machine)\\n Run in a Virtual Machine\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThis setup is not recommended for use in production for a few reasons, namely:\\n\\n*   application level updates: we tend to move quite fast, and if things get busy, blink twice and you’re on an outdated server. this has security implications too.\\n*   guaranteed uptime: from our experience, vm’s tend to restart now and then (they need updates and reboots too), which results in downtime.\\n*   database backups - again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   end-to-end encryption: possibly less of daily concern - we’re offering from encryption at rest, to https security (SSL/TLS certs & renewal) - so whenever data travels between a client and the db it’s always encrypted, inc. inside the datacenter itself.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\nThis is the easiest way to get the Server running.\\n\\nAs prerequisites, you only need a Linux VM with at least 4 GB of RAM and have [Docker (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)\\n and [Docker Compose (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)\\n installed.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-create-a-directory-for-this-deployment-on-the-system)\\n Step 1: Create a Directory for this Deployment on the System\\n\\n    mkdir /opt/speckle/\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#step-2-copy-and-paste-this-into-a-file-named-docker-compose-yml-in-your-directory)\\n Step 2: Copy and paste this into a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your directory\\n\\n    version: \"2.3\"\\n    name: \"speckle-server\"\\n    \\n    services:\\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server dependencies\\n      #######\\n      postgres:\\n        image: \"postgres:14.5-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          POSTGRES_DB: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_USER: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: speckle\\n        volumes:\\n          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/\\n        healthcheck:\\n          # the -U user has to match the POSTGRES_USER value\\n          test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready -U speckle\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      redis:\\n        image: \"redis:7-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - redis-data:/data\\n        ports:\\n          - \"127.0.0.1:6379:6379\"\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"--raw\", \"incr\", \"ping\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      minio:\\n        image: \"minio/minio\"\\n        command: server /data --console-address \":9001\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - minio-data:/data\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"mc\", \"ready\", \"local\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 5\\n    \\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server\\n      #######\\n      speckle-ingress:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-docker-compose-ingress:2\\n        restart: always\\n        ports:\\n          - \"0.0.0.0:80:8080\"\\n        environment:\\n          FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_MB: \"100\"\\n          NGINX_ENVSUBST_OUTPUT_DIR: \"/etc/nginx\"\\n    \\n      speckle-frontend-2:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-frontend-2:2\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME: \"local\"\\n          # TODO: Change NUXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN to the URL of the speckle server, as accessed from the network.

You can find instructions on how to do that [here](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n.\\n\\nTo update Speckle:\\n\\n1.  connect to the virtual machine running the Speckle server instance\\n2.  navigate to the folder, where the Speckle server docker-compose file is located\\n3.  run `docker compose down` (this will take the server offline)\\n4.  review the latest changes in this guide against your `docker-compose.yml` file, and amend as necessary.\\n5.  run `docker compose pull` (this will retrieve the latest images)\\n6.  run `docker compose up -d` (this starts the server stack, and runs it in the background)\\n\\nYour server instance should be back online and updated.\\n\\n[#](#run-your-speckle-server-fork)\\n Run Your Speckle-Server Fork\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you made some changes to the server and want to run those instead of the official releases, we created some useful docker-compose.yml files to help with that.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-set-up-dependencies)\\n Step 1: Set up Dependencies\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you set up PostgreSQL, Redis and S3-compatible service outside of this VM (for example a managed deployment from a cloud provider), you can skip this step, but remember to set up the correct environment variables later\\n\\nTo get the PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO dependencies up and running in the VM, our git repo contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-deps.yml)\\n for running these dependencies locally in docker containers.\\n\\nIt also includes `PGAdmin` and `redis-insight` to be able to explore the raw data. If you don\\'t need them, you can safely remove those entries from the `docker-compose-deps.yml` file.\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _PostgreSQL v13_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:5432` with default credentials `speckle`:`speckle` and a database named `speckle`.\\n*   _Redis v6_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:6379`\\n*   _PGAdmin4_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:16543` with default credentials `admin@localhost` : `admin`\\n*   _Redis Insight_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:8001`\\n*   _MinIO_, listening on `127.0.0.1:9000` with the API endpoint and on `127.0.0.1:9001` with the Web Management Interface (default credentials used: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)\\n\\nAll of the above containers listen on the local loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`) and are NOT accessible from the local network (for security, since they use default credentials)\\n\\nTo use PGAdmin, after login you can configure a server connection to the host `postgres` (user `speckle`, password `speckle`, database `speckle`)\\n\\nTo use Redis Insight, you can configure it to connect to the hostname `redis` (port `6379`)\\n\\nDocker Compose creates named docker volumes for storing data for each of the containers, so data is persisted. You can view existing docker volumes with `docker volume ls` and delete a volume and existing data with `docker volume rm [volume_name]`\\n\\n### [#](#step-2-build-and-run-your-code)\\n Step 2: Build and Run Your Code\\n\\nThe git repository contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-speckle.yml)\\n for building and running the Speckle server frontend and backend in docker containers.\\n\\nTo use it, first edit the variables in the `docker-compose-speckle.yml` file to reflect your environment. Then, you can start them with:\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-speckle.yml up --build -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\n(You can safely ignore the warnings about the _orphan containers_)\\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _docker-compose-ingress_, an nginx container that routes traffic to either speckle-frontend-2 or speckle-server as required. This is exposed on port 80 in the VM network.\\n*   _speckle-frontend-2_, the frontend Vue app. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _speckle-server_, the `server` component. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _preview-service_, the component that generates stream previews. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _webhook-service_, the component that calls webhooks. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _fileimport-service_, the component that imports uploaded files.

This is a high efficiency getting started step list.\\n\\n[#](#supported-platforms)\\n Supported Platforms\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle server has been developed on Linux, Windows WSL2, and MacOS. It _does not_ work on Windows without WSL2.\\n\\nOn MacOS devices with Apple based chips (M2, M3 etc.) it is possible to run the server as described below, but building and running Dockerfiles takes a lot of time (due to emulation of an x86 platform).\\n\\n### [#](#steps)\\n Steps\\n\\n1.  `git clone git@github.com:specklesystems/speckle-server.git` or, alternatively `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git`\\n2.  `cd speckle-server`\\n3.  `corepack enable`\\n4.  `yarn`\\n5.  `yarn build`\\n6.  `yarn dev:docker:up`\\n7.  `cp packages/server/.env-example packages/server/.env`\\n8.  `cp packages/server/.env.test-example packages/server/.env.test`\\n9.  `cp packages/frontend-2/.env.example packages/frontend-2/.env`\\n10.  `cp packages/dui3/.env.example packages/dui3/.env`\\n11.  `yarn dev`\\n\\nWait for the frontend to build, and voila, you have a fully functional Speckle Server running at [http://localhost:3000 (opens new window)](http://localhost:3000)\\n.\\n\\nTo run a specific part of the Speckle server stack, go to the [components](#components)\\n section\\n\\n[#](#details)\\n Details\\n----------------------\\n\\nLet's step back and see what we did.\\n\\n1.  To clone the repo git with [ssh key (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\\n     auth was used. You can use https based auth too, and can also gather some bonus points by using the `gh-cli` 😄\\n2.  We change into the cloned repository directory.\\n3.  Nodejs versions ^16 now come with a package manager manager bundled named `corepack`. It enables us to use yarn without actually installing anything.\\n4.  The monorepo is managed by [yarn workspaces (opens new window)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)\\n    . This way the package manager handles dependencies of the monorepo and the proper connections between the different packages. Running `yarn` a shorthand for `yarn install` bootstraps the repo.\\n5.  Some of the local packages (viewer, object loader) has to be built the first time so that all packages are linked properly. This can be done easily with a yarn script, where the yarn command will execute the given build script in all packages where it exists. So running `yarn build` triggers all available build commands.\\n6.  In this step, all the required services are started via docker compose. The `docker-compose-deps.yml` file contains a sensible default setup of all the required non Speckle developed services. This config by no means meant to be used in production. If you are not running these dependencies via docker compose, please make sure, that their configuration options are in line with either the compose file or the individual package configurations.\\n7.  In this step the provided example file is copied to a `.env` file with keeping the default values. Here again we are providing a set of sensible defaults that work out of the box if you follow this guide, but do make sure to reflect any changes you make in you environment.\\n8.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied when running tests or running the server in test mode\\n9.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to the new frontend\\n10.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to dui3\\n11.  Just like above, we use yarn to run the `dev` script in each package. This is probably not the most efficient way, since it starts more packages in development mode, than needed, but its the easiest command that gets a server up and running. When developing, you probably want to run each component separately. A good enough setup might be to just run the server and the preferred frontend (run `yarn dev` only in those individual package directories).\\n\\nWhen running `yarn dev` for all packages you might see errors relating to `@speckle/shared` being missing, but this is only temporarily because `@speckle/shared` is also being re-built at that point in time. Once its finished building all of the other packages should pick up on it and work fine. You might also see GraphQL Codegen errors, which also are temporary, because they rely on the speckle server being up and running.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon't forget to set up the variables in the `.env` & `.env.test` files according to your deployment\\n\\n[#](#components)\\n Components\\n----------------------------\\n\\nTo run a barebones Speckle Server, you need to run:\\n\\n*   the `frontend-2` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/frontend-2)\\n    )\\n*   the `server` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/server)\\n    )\\n\\nOptionally, to enable extra functionality, microservices should be run separately. For more information, check their `README.md` file in the git repository:\\n\\n*   the `preview-service` package generates preview images for streams (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/preview-service)\\n    )\\n*   the `webhook-service` package is responsible with calling the configured webhooks\\n*   the `fileimport-service` package parses and imports uploaded files into Speckle.\\n\\nDetailed instructions for running them locally are kept up to date in their respective `readme.md` files.\\n\\nIn this deployment type, the frontend Vue app will listen by default on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 8080`, but will have no knowledge about the `server` component, and thus **should not be accessed directly**.\\n\\nThe server component will listen on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 3000`, and will proxy the frontend requests to the frontend component (as configured in .env file).\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/server-local-dev.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/8/2024, 8:34:04 AM\\n\\n← [Deploying a Server - Docker Compose](/dev/server-manualsetup.html) [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)\", metadata={'title': 'Local Development Environment | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/server-local-dev.html'}),\n",

In the dialog box in the `Connection` tab:\\n    \\n    *   for the `Host name/addresses` enter the name of the Postgres container, in our example it is `speckle-server-postgres-1`\\n        *   the name of the Postgres container can be found with `docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'`\\n    *   for `port`, use `5432` (or the value discovered when running `docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'`, see instructions above).\\n    *   for `database`, `username`, and `password` use the values in your configuration assigned to the respective `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` keys. If installed with Speckle\\'s manual installation, by default the value of these are all `speckle`.\\n5.  (optional) For some databases, but not the default database provided by Speckle, you may also have to provide a Certificate.\\n    \\n    1.  Copy this certificate into the pgadmin container with `docker cp ./local/path/to/my/certificate.crt speckle-server-pgadmin-1:/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/` (assuming the default pgadmin user is `admin@localhost.com` and `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` is the name of the pgAdmin container.)\\n    2.

Click `save`.\\n    \\n\\n### [#](#backing-up-postgres)\\n Backing-up Postgres\\n\\n1.  You can now select the database from the browser window (typically found on the left hand side). Expand `docker-compose` and `databases` to select your database. The default database name for Speckle is `speckle`.\\n    \\n2.  Once you have found the database in pgAdmin, right-click the database name and select `backup`.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/04_pgadmin_backup.47b980b4.png)\\n    \\n3.  Provide a filename in the `general` tab.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/05_pgadmin_backup_dialog.b772dd50.png)\\n    \\n4.  In the `options` tab, select the options `Include CREATE DATABASE statement` and `Include DROP DATABASE statement`.\\n    \\n5.  Then start the backup process. This will generate a backup that is stored in the container\\'s volume.\\n    \\n6.  Once the backup is prepared, we now need to save the file to your local machine.\\n    \\n    *   If a `Click to open file location` button is displayed (this may depend on the version of pgAdmin running), click on it and download the backup to your machine.\\n        \\n    *   If a button is not displayed, you can copy the file from the container to your machine by user docker. Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n        \\n            docker cp speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/BACKUP_FILE_NAME\\' .\\n            \\n        \\n        1  \\n        \\n    *   If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake further steps to move the file from the host machine to either your local machine or storage location of your choice. DigitalOcean [suggest using `scp` (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-copy-files-from-one-server-to-another-droplet)\\n        .\\n        \\n7.  We recommend testing the integrity of the backup at this time. One way of doing this is to install speckle-server on another machine (or modify the name and ports in the file and install a second locally), then upload the backup per the below instructions using pgAdmin. Use pgAdmin or Speckle to check that the information is present.\\n    \\n8.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\n### [#](#backing-up-a-docker-volume-optional)\\n Backing up a Docker Volume (Optional)\\n\\nAs well as creating a Postgres backup, we also recommend a full Docker volume backup. The Docker volume backup can only be used with the current version of Postgres, so is more limited than the Postgres backup created via pgAdmin (the latter allows us to move data between different versions of Postgres, which is useful when upgrading). Generating an additional backup from the Docker volume provides us with additional confidence that we can recover to a previous good working state.\\n\\n1.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  Follow the instructions on backing up a Docker Volume in [Docker\\'s Documentation (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)\\n    \\n3.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\nIf you are not upgrading the Postgres database, you can stop at this step. The following instructions relate only to the event of a major version upgrade of Postgres.\\n\\n### [#](#preparing-postgres-for-an-upgrade)\\n Preparing Postgres for an upgrade\\n\\n1.  Determine the name of the Docker container that is running your Postgres database, and the version of Postgres.\\n    \\n        docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  If successful, the above will print out something similar to the below. In our example the name is `speckle-server-postgres-1` and the image version `13-alpine`.\\n    \\n        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                      NAMES\\n        510e024a4700   postgres:13-alpine   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp   speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    2  \\n    \\n3.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step will cause Speckle, and any other application relying on the database, to stop working until the database is restored. You may wish to notify users of your Speckle server about the disruption to Speckle before proceeding with this and the following steps. Stop your Postgres database with the following command, replacing `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker stop speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Remove the container from docker, this detaches it from its volume and allows the volume to be deleted. Replace `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker rm speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  During upgrades we recommend undertaking a Docker volume backup. This allows us to restore to the previous version if the upgrade was unsuccessful. See the instructions for undertaking a Docker volume backup in the section above.\\n    \\n7.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step is destructive and cannot be undone, please ensure that the backup is correct and saved securely before proceeding - see instructions above. Delete the volume storing your Postgres database, replacing `speckle-server_postgres-data` with the name of your Postgres volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume rm speckle-server_postgres-data\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n#### [#](#upgrading-postgres)\\n Upgrading Postgres\\n\\n1.  If you installed Postgres using Docker Compose, please log into the machine in which you installed it.\\n    \\n2.  Using `git`, clone the Speckle Server repository. More details instructions are available in GitHub\\'s documentation.\\n    \\n        git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.\\n    \\n        cd speckle-server\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Check out the version of Speckle Server you wish to deploy. For example, using `git` on the command line to checkout a tagged version - in this case Speckle Server version `2.9.0` (please change to the [latest released version (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/releases)\\n    , or the version you wish to deploy):\\n    \\n        git checkout tags/2.9.0 -b main\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Deploy the docker-compose file with the updated Postgres version:\\n    \\n        docker compose -f ./docker-compose-deps.yml up --detach\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  Verify everything is up and running by viewing the status of all containers:\\n    \\n        docker ps\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n### [#](#restoring-your-data-to-postgres-from-pgadmin-backup)\\n Restoring your Data to Postgres from pgAdmin Backup\\n\\n1.  If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake steps to move the file your local machine or storage location to the host machine (Droplet).

Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n    \\n        docker cp BACKUP_FILE_NAME speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Connect to pgAdmin using the instructions above.\\n    \\n4.  Connect pgAdmin to the server using the instructions above.\\n    \\n5.  Right-click `databases` from the browser window, and click `create`. The name of the database should be `speckle`.\\n    \\n6.  Right-click the created database and click `restore`, selecting your previously stored backup. You will need to upload the backup you previously downloaded back into pgAdmin first.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/06_pgadmin_restore.85bf2552.png)\\n    \\n7.  If you encounter errors at this point, it may be because pgAdmin considers the database to be a `maintenance database`. To workaround this issue please try the following:\\n    \\n    1.

They function like ordinary OAuth access tokens, and they enable a script, an app, or any other piece of code to **act on your behalf**.\\n\\nThis means that with a token, an app or script is able to:\\n\\n*   read any streams you have access to\\n*   create streams on your behalf\\n*   share those streams with other users\\n*   create commits against a stream you have write access to\\n*   read the profile (public information) of other users.\\n\\nSecurity advisory\\n\\nTreat any personal access tokens like a password: do not post them anywhere where they could be accessed by others (e.g., public repos).\\n\\n[#](#creating-a-token)\\n Creating a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, you need to login and go to your profile (/profile). Just under \"Your Apps\" section, you will see a list of all the personal access tokens that you have created so far, and you\\'ll be able to create a new one.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens1.dfd285b0.png)\\n\\nTo create a new token, click on the new token button. A dialog will appear that will ask you for some basic details about it.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens2.ad8a0c88.png)\\n\\nThe token name should be something that you can remember. The token scopes define what actions can be taken with that specific token.\\n\\nToken Scopes\\n\\nIt\\'s good practice to limit the scopes to minimum required ones. For example, if you\\'re creating a script or app that just **reads** from streams, and doesn\\'t need to create new ones, or edit existing ones, just assign it the `streams:read` scope.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens3.09032568.png)\\n\\nOnce your token is created, the dialog will display it. This is the first and last time you will be able to see the full token and you should store it somewhere safe now.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens4.2dbb6491.png)\\n\\n[#](#using-a-token)\\n Using a Token\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you have a token, you usually will need to pass it as an authorization header in any server bound requests.\\n\\nFor example, here is a simple request to get the total count of your streams using javascript:\\n\\n    let res = await fetch(\\'/graphql\\', {\\n      method: \\'POST\\',\\n      headers: {\\n        Authorization: \\'Bearer \\' + token, // <- Passing in the token!\\n        \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'\\n      },\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ user { id streams { totalCount } } }` })\\n    })\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n\\nNote that the token needs to be prefixed with the word `Bearer`; a full token would look like `Bearer xxx`.\\n\\n[#](#revoking-a-token)\\n Revoking a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'re no longer using a token, or you think it may be compromised (did you commit it by accident to a public github repo?), you can revoke a token. It will be completely disabled and no more actions will be able to be taken with it.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nAs soon as possible afterwards, make sure any scripts or apps using that token did not break!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/tokens.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 9/6/2022, 12:01:02 PM\\n\\n← [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html) [Creating Your Own App](/dev/apps.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Personal Access Tokens | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/tokens.html'}),\n",

It\\'s geared towards an audience that is familiar with Javascript and web development, or at least not scared by it!\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ll be creating a very simple web app capable of:\\n\\n*   Authenticating a user through a Speckle server OAuth.\\n*   Search for stream\\'s available to the user.\\n*   Display commit data associated with a given stream.\\n*   Filter the data to be displayed.\\n*   Cache results in `localStorage` to _remember_ the app state across page reloads.\\n\\nLet\\'s get started! 🚀\\n\\nFollowing along\\n\\nIf too busy to follow all the steps, you can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-demo-app)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#requirements)\\n Requirements\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guide should work in any platform (Mac/Linux/Windows). We\\'ll be using _VSCode_ as our IDE but you can use any other (even Notepad if your brave enough!).\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need to have Node installed, as well as `vue-cli` and have some basic understanding of how Vue works.\\n\\nInstalling the prerequisites\\n\\n**Node:** Probably the easiest way to manage your node installation is through `nvm`. On Windows, you can [use this guide (opens new window)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#install-nvm-windows)\\n. If on OSX, you can use the [original nvm (opens new window)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)\\n.\\n\\n**Vue CLI**: Once you have node installed, it\\'s just a matter of running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.\\n\\nGetting familiar with Vue\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t used Vue before, don\\'t worry. It\\'s quite easy to get started with it - here\\'s [some docs (opens new window)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)\\n you could run through beforehand.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also be using some of Vue\\'s most popular plugins: `vuex` and `vue-router`. If you\\'re unfamiliar with them, they have great quick-start guides on their site!\\n\\n*   [`vuex`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n*   [`vue-router`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#setting-up-the-vue-app)\\n Setting up the Vue app\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the simplest step. Open a new terminal, set the current directory to wherever you want the project to be located and run the following command:\\n\\n    vue create speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nThis will ask you some questions, such as the version of vue to use, what plugins to install, etc. **It is important that you answer the questions correctly**, otherwise, your project may be missing some key features.\\n\\nVue setup - Step by step\\n\\n1.  When prompted for a preset, select **Manually select features** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step1.dcfa5f44.png)\\n2.  Next, specify the features needed for this project:\\n    *   Choose vue version\\n    *   Babel\\n    *   PWA\\n    *   Router\\n    *   Vuex\\n    *   CSS Pre-processors\\n    *   Linter ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step2.05778446.png)\\n3.  Choose version **2.x** of Vue.js ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step3.4097c34f.png)\\n4.  Choose **Yes** when prompted to use **history mode for router** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step4.ec673eac.png)\\n5.  For the css-preprocessor to use, select **Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step5.c8848709.png)\\n6.  When prompted for a Linter, choose the option **ESLint with error prevention only** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step6.fc39a92e.png)\\n7.  When prompted for additional lint features, select **Lint on save** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step7.d4eddbd5.png)\\n8.  Choose to place config files **In dedicated config files** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step8.cfe4baaf.png)\\n9.  At last, you can save this selection as a preset, but for this time just select **No** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step9.b8f89232.png)\\n10.  Wait for the process to finish ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step10.4d92a129.png) \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with this process, just select the same answers as the screenshot bellow:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup.55edbdef.png)\\n\\nOnce done, you\\'d have your Vue project ready. To open the project in **VSCode** we just need to run:\\n\\n    code speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nThis step assumes you already installed VSCode in your path. If you haven\\'t, there\\'s a command for it in VSCode.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vscode-shell-install.df19f814.png)\\n\\n### [#](#install-other-dependencies)\\n Install other dependencies\\n\\nFor our UI, we\\'ll also be using [Vuetify](TODO)\\n to make our life easier, as it has many useful components. To add it, run:\\n\\n    vue add vuetify\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWhen asked for a preset, choose **Default**.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also need to add a couple of handy dependencies such as `vuex-persist` for state storage, `vue2-timeago` to display user-friendly dates and `debounce`. For this, run the following command:\\n\\n    npm i vuex-persist vue2-timeago debounce\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#run-your-app-for-the-first-time)\\n Run your app for the first time\\n\\nIf everything went well, running the following command should make the app available at [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](http://localhost:8080)\\n.\\n\\n    npm run serve\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIn chrome, things should be looking like this:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-setup-preview.a007a970.png)\\n\\n[#](#authenticating-with-the-server)\\n Authenticating with the Server\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#creating-the-speckle-files)\\n Creating the `Speckle` files\\n\\nFor convenience, we\\'re going to isolate all the `speckle` related code into 2 files:\\n\\n*   `src/speckleQueries.js` will hold some utility functions to build our `GraphQL` queries.\\n*   `src/speckleUtils.js` will hold all call\\'s to the Speckle server, as well as some constants. It will deal with login/logout functionality too.\\n\\n### [#](#registering-an-application-on-the-speckle-server)\\n Registering an Application on the Speckle Server\\n\\nIn order to be able to talk to our Speckle server, we first need to `Create an App` in that server with an existing account. To do that, visit the server\\'s frontend [https://app.speckle.systems (opens new window)](https://app.speckle.systems)\\n, log in with your account and visit the profile page.\\n\\nScroll down until you see the `Applications` section, and press the `New App` button. A pop-up should appear, fill it in as follows:\\n\\n*   **Name:** SpeckleDemoApp\\n*   **Scopes**: `stream:read`, `profile:read`, `profile:email`\\n*   **Redirect url**: `http://localhost:8080`\\n*   **Description**: My first speckle app\\n\\nOnce accepted, you\\'ll see the `App Id` and `App Secret`, as well as an indication to the url pattern we should use (`https://app.speckle.systems/authn/verify/{appId}/{challenge}`).\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nNote that the `redirect url` points to our local computer network. When deploying this app to a service like Netlify, we\\'ll have to create a new one pointing to the correct Netlify url.\\n\\n#### [#](#saving-app-credentials-as-env-variables)\\n Saving app credentials as ENV variables\\n\\nThe `App Id` and `App Secret` are used to identify your app, so you should never add them to your version control. Instead, we\\'ll be using `ENV` variables to save that information, which also allows us to modify it in different scenarios (development/production).\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor those of you who wonder, frontend applications that integrate with the Speckle Server are treated as OAuth **public applications**, because they cannot keep their id and secret safe.\\n\\nVue will automatically read any `.env` files in the root of your project and load the variables accordingly, but will also replace all references with the actual value of the variable on compilation (which we **do not want**). We can tell `vue.js` to not do this by creating a file named `.env.local` instead. The contents should look like this 👇🏼 (remember to replace your ID and Secret appropriately).\\n\\n    # The Speckle Application Id\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_ID=YOUR_APP_ID \\n    \\n    # The Speckle Application Secret\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET\\n    \\n    VUE_APP_SERVER_URL=https://app.speckle.systems\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME=\"Speckle Demo App\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n### [#](#login-in-with-speckle)\\n Login in with Speckle\\n\\nA simplified version of the auth flow with a Speckle Server can be summarised as follows:\\n\\n1.  User clicks the Login button\\n2.  User is redirected to the auth page in the Speckle server (using the provided url pattern when creating an application)\\n3.  User will log in and allow the app to access their data (hopefully?).\\n4.  User is redirected to our specified `Redirect URL`, with an attached `access_code`.\\n5.  Using that access code, we can exchange it for a pair of `token/refresh token`, which is what allows the app to \"talk\" to the server as that user. We\\'ll save those in `localStorage`.\\n\\nThis may sound rather complicated, but it boils down to 2 different interactions (redirect your user and exchange the access code).\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-auth-functions-to-speckleutils-js)\\n Adding auth functions to `speckleUtils.js`\\n\\nIn our `src/speckleUtils.js` file, paste in the following code. You\\'ll find some constants that refer to our previously set `ENV` variables, as well as several functions.\\n\\n*   `goToSpeckleAuthPage`: Will generate a random challenge, save it in localStorage and direct the url to the auth page in the specified speckle server.\\n*   `exchangeAccessCode`: Will `fetch` from the server a new pair of `token/refresh token` and clear the `challenge`.\\n*   `speckleLogOut`: Will erase all necessary data from `localStorage`.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nNote that `goToSpeckleAuthPage` saves the challenge, and `exchangeAccessCode` uses that same challenge to exchange the tokens.

Selecting one of the result items will change the selection text from `No stream selected` to display the selected Stream name and id, as well as 2 buttons. The first one will take you to the stream page in the server, while the second one will clear the selection in the app state.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-stream-search.641f64ce.gif)\\n\\n[#](#displaying-stream-commits)\\n Displaying stream commits\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo far, we\\'ve managed to authenticate with our Speckle server, fetch user and server information and search for available streams, as well as storing the results in our app state.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use our `selectedStream` to display a table with all it\\'s commits, as well as some data associated with each commit. Since the commit list can be rather large, we\\'ll be adding basic pagination functionality to the table.\\n\\nFor that, we\\'ll need to fetch the commit data associated with the stream, modify our `store/index.js` to hold that new data, and add a table view with a column filter on `Home.vue`\\n\\n### [#](#create-fetch-query)\\n Create fetch query\\n\\nLet\\'s start by adding a new query function to our `speckleQueries.js`\\n\\n    export const streamCommitsQuery = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) => `query {\\n        stream(id: \"${streamId}\"){\\n          commits(limit: ${itemsPerPage}, cursor: ${\\n      cursor ? \\'\"\\' + cursor + \\'\"\\' : null\\n    }) {\\n            totalCount\\n            cursor\\n            items{\\n              id\\n              message\\n              branchName\\n              sourceApplication\\n              referencedObject\\n              authorName\\n              createdAt\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }`\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nAnd add the following to `speckleUtils.js` (remember to import the `streamCommitsQuery`)\\n\\n    export const getStreamCommits = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) =>\\n      speckleFetch(streamCommitsQuery(streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor))\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nNotice that the query has a `cursor`. This is used to get successive _pages_ of the commits list. There is a current limitation with the cursor, as it only allows to go _forward_ in pages, not backward. To fix this, we\\'ll keep track of these values in our store so we can have pagination going forward (we\\'ll also keep the `itemsPerPage` value fixed to keep things simple).\\n\\n[#](#update-store-index-js)\\n Update `store/index.js`\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, there\\'s quite a bit of modifications in the `store/index.js` file.

`previousCursors` is a list, so we added two mutations: one to push a new value and another to replace the entire list)\\n*   Add `getCommits` action, and update `logout`, `handleStreamSelection` and

*   The `v-data-table` does all the table UI magic so we don\\'t have to.\\n*   Add several computed properties:\\n    *   `commits` and `previousCursors` to fetch the data from our store\\n    *   `availableKeys` and `filteredHeaders` are helper functions to extract all available keys from the received commit data and format the headers the way `v-data-table` likes them.\\n*   Add new data

Go ahead to [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](https://localhost:8080)\\n. If logged in, your app should be looking like this 👇🏼\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-full-demo.1024d106.gif)\\n\\n[#](#adding-data-persistence)\\n Adding data persistence\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur app seems to be working fine, but there\\'s still a small adjustment that we can do to make things better. If, for any reason, a user reloads the page, they will loose their current stream selection + commit results, which is annoying. Let\\'s fix that!\\n\\nThankfully, we only need to modify the `store/index.js` file slightly to make this happen. We already installed `vuex-persist`, the plugin that will do all the heavy lifting for us.\\n\\nFirst, import vuex-persist:\\n\\n    import VuexPersistence from \"vuex-persist\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nthen create an instance (you\\'ll need to import `APP_NAME` from `speckleUtils.js`) that uses `localStorage`. We could also use `sessionStorage`, which would be deleted at the end of the session.\\n\\n    const vuexLocal = new VuexPersistence({\\n      storage: window.localStorage,\\n      key: `${APP_NAME}.vuex`\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nadd a `plugins` property to the `Vuex.Store` constructor config:\\n\\n    export default new Vuex.Store({\\n      plugins: [vuexLocal.plugin],\\n      ...\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nand that\\'s it! Your app should now persist the app state across page refresh. 🚀\\n\\n[#](#publish-to-netlify)\\n Publish to Netlify\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we have our app up and running locally, there\\'s just one last thing to do: deploy it!\\n\\nWe\\'ll be using Netlify for this guide, but you could also as easily use Heroku, or any other platforms that supports web-app s like Vue.js out of the box.\\n\\nFirst, you\\'ll need a GitHub account to push your app\\'s repo to, and a Netlify account. If you haven\\'t got a netlify account yet, you can log in with your GitHub account, which will make your life easier.\\n\\n### [#](#create-your-site)\\n Create your site\\n\\n1.  Go to your Netlify\\'s dashboard and find the `New site from Git` button ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site.88cb7d26.png)\\n2.  Follow the steps as shown:\\n    1.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-2.1f6bdff9.png)\\n    2.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-3.d288f521.png)\\n    3.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-4.ca2b8d4b.png)\\n    4.  Once this is done, you\\'ll have a netlify url where you\\'re app will live.\\n3.  Create a new Application on the Speckle server and set it\\'s callback url to the application url you just got from Netlify. This will give you a new `appId` and `appSecret`.\\n4.  Last step is to set the `env` variables, similar to how we did it for our development server.\\n    1.  Go to `Site Settings`\\\\->`Build and Deploy`\\\\-`Environment`\\n    2.  Add the same environment variables as in your `.env.local` file but using the `appId` and `appSecret` values from step 3. ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-env.167695cc.png)\\n5.  Go to the `Deploys` section of your app, find the `Trigger Deploy` button and select the `Deploy Site` option. This will force your app to restart and detect the new env variables.\\n\\nThat\\'s it! If you visit your netlify url, you should see your app running smoothly!\\n\\n[#](#wrapping-it-up)\\n Wrapping it up\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve covered quite a lot on this guide, but this was only a small example of interacting with Speckle streams and commits. Expanding on this further can move onto using the Speckle Viewer, fetch the data inside commits, receive notifications from the server, and more!\\n\\nCode Repository\\n\\nYou can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository.

We have all the tools ready for you to start developing your own!\\n\\nWe are very enthusiastic about community connectors and would love to help you bring them to life. To get started, check out the guide below. Feel free to reach out with any questions or calls for more contributors to the project on our [forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#before-you-begin)\\n Before you Begin\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore you begin writing your own connector, we encourage you to follow the steps below:\\n\\n1.  **make sure you are comfortable** writing plugins for the host application you are planning to target, otherwise the guide below will not be of great help 😅\\n2.  **post on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n    ** announcing what you are planning to develop and how\\n3.  **consider** that if you make your connector publicly available, it\\'s going to be your own responsibility to maintain it\\n4.  **check whether the [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n     kit is fit** to support your future connector, if it might need to be extended or if you might want to develop a new kit as well\\n5.  **read** our [dev docs on Base object, kits, transports](/dev/base.html)\\n     etc...\\n\\n[#](#anatomy-of-a-connector)\\n Anatomy of a Connector\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nConnectors are made of the following parts:\\n\\n*   **a User Interface**\\n*   **bindings** between the host application and the UI\\n*   **custom logic** specific to the host application (for selecting elements, saving senders and receivers in the project file etc)\\n*   **a converter** to convert between the host application and Speckle geometry and BIM elements\\n\\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we\\'ll be using a user interface called [DesktopUI](/user/ui)\\n currently in use by our Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD and Civil 3D connectors. But you can of course create your own or use whatever the host application you are integrating with provides - that\\'s the case of visual programming software.\\n\\n[#](#getting-started)\\n Getting Started\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nTo get started, create a C# project in your IDE of choice by following the conventions and requirements for writing plugins for the host application you are targeting. In most cases you\\'ll be creating a .NET Framework class library project.\\n\\nTo be consistent with other Speckle connectors you should name your project `ConnectorAPP_NAME`, set the Assembly name to `SpeckleConnectorAPP_NAME` and the namespace to `Speckle.ConnectorAPP_NAME` where `APP_NAME` is the name of your host application (eg Tekla, Etabs...).\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nThe minimum supported .NET Framework for using our .NET SDK is **4.6.1**\\n\\nThen you can proceed to add the following packages from NuGet:\\n\\n*   `Speckle.DesktopUI`\\n*   `Speckle.Objects`\\n\\n![](data:image/png;base64,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

It\\'s geared towards an audience that is familiar with Javascript and web development, or at least not scared by it!\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ll be creating a very simple web app capable of:\\n\\n*   Authenticating a user through a Speckle server OAuth.\\n*   Search for stream\\'s available to the user.\\n*   Display commit data associated with a given stream.\\n*   Filter the data to be displayed.\\n*   Cache results in `localStorage` to _remember_ the app state across page reloads.\\n\\nLet\\'s get started! 🚀\\n\\nFollowing along\\n\\nIf too busy to follow all the steps, you can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-demo-app)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#requirements)\\n Requirements\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guide should work in any platform (Mac/Linux/Windows). We\\'ll be using _VSCode_ as our IDE but you can use any other (even Notepad if your brave enough!).\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need to have Node installed, as well as `vue-cli` and have some basic understanding of how Vue works.\\n\\nInstalling the prerequisites\\n\\n**Node:** Probably the easiest way to manage your node installation is through `nvm`. On Windows, you can [use this guide (opens new window)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#install-nvm-windows)\\n. If on OSX, you can use the [original nvm (opens new window)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)\\n.\\n\\n**Vue CLI**: Once you have node installed, it\\'s just a matter of running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.\\n\\nGetting familiar with Vue\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t used Vue before, don\\'t worry. It\\'s quite easy to get started with it - here\\'s [some docs (opens new window)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)\\n you could run through beforehand.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also be using some of Vue\\'s most popular plugins: `vuex` and `vue-router`. If you\\'re unfamiliar with them, they have great quick-start guides on their site!\\n\\n*   [`vuex`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n*   [`vue-router`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#setting-up-the-vue-app)\\n Setting up the Vue app\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the simplest step. Open a new terminal, set the current directory to wherever you want the project to be located and run the following command:\\n\\n    vue create speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nThis will ask you some questions, such as the version of vue to use, what plugins to install, etc. **It is important that you answer the questions correctly**, otherwise, your project may be missing some key features.\\n\\nVue setup - Step by step\\n\\n1.  When prompted for a preset, select **Manually select features** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step1.dcfa5f44.png)\\n2.  Next, specify the features needed for this project:\\n    *   Choose vue version\\n    *   Babel\\n    *   PWA\\n    *   Router\\n    *   Vuex\\n    *   CSS Pre-processors\\n    *   Linter ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step2.05778446.png)\\n3.  Choose version **2.x** of Vue.js ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step3.4097c34f.png)\\n4.  Choose **Yes** when prompted to use **history mode for router** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step4.ec673eac.png)\\n5.  For the css-preprocessor to use, select **Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step5.c8848709.png)\\n6.  When prompted for a Linter, choose the option **ESLint with error prevention only** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step6.fc39a92e.png)\\n7.  When prompted for additional lint features, select **Lint on save** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step7.d4eddbd5.png)\\n8.  Choose to place config files **In dedicated config files** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step8.cfe4baaf.png)\\n9.  At last, you can save this selection as a preset, but for this time just select **No** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step9.b8f89232.png)\\n10.  Wait for the process to finish ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step10.4d92a129.png) \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with this process, just select the same answers as the screenshot bellow:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup.55edbdef.png)\\n\\nOnce done, you\\'d have your Vue project ready. To open the project in **VSCode** we just need to run:\\n\\n    code speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nThis step assumes you already installed VSCode in your path. If you haven\\'t, there\\'s a command for it in VSCode.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vscode-shell-install.df19f814.png)\\n\\n### [#](#install-other-dependencies)\\n Install other dependencies\\n\\nFor our UI, we\\'ll also be using [Vuetify](TODO)\\n to make our life easier, as it has many useful components. To add it, run:\\n\\n    vue add vuetify\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWhen asked for a preset, choose **Default**.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also need to add a couple of handy dependencies such as `vuex-persist` for state storage, `vue2-timeago` to display user-friendly dates and `debounce`. For this, run the following command:\\n\\n    npm i vuex-persist vue2-timeago debounce\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#run-your-app-for-the-first-time)\\n Run your app for the first time\\n\\nIf everything went well, running the following command should make the app available at [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](http://localhost:8080)\\n.\\n\\n    npm run serve\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIn chrome, things should be looking like this:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-setup-preview.a007a970.png)\\n\\n[#](#authenticating-with-the-server)\\n Authenticating with the Server\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#creating-the-speckle-files)\\n Creating the `Speckle` files\\n\\nFor convenience, we\\'re going to isolate all the `speckle` related code into 2 files:\\n\\n*   `src/speckleQueries.js` will hold some utility functions to build our `GraphQL` queries.\\n*   `src/speckleUtils.js` will hold all call\\'s to the Speckle server, as well as some constants. It will deal with login/logout functionality too.\\n\\n### [#](#registering-an-application-on-the-speckle-server)\\n Registering an Application on the Speckle Server\\n\\nIn order to be able to talk to our Speckle server, we first need to `Create an App` in that server with an existing account. To do that, visit the server\\'s frontend [https://app.speckle.systems (opens new window)](https://app.speckle.systems)\\n, log in with your account and visit the profile page.\\n\\nScroll down until you see the `Applications` section, and press the `New App` button. A pop-up should appear, fill it in as follows:\\n\\n*   **Name:** SpeckleDemoApp\\n*   **Scopes**: `stream:read`, `profile:read`, `profile:email`\\n*   **Redirect url**: `http://localhost:8080`\\n*   **Description**: My first speckle app\\n\\nOnce accepted, you\\'ll see the `App Id` and `App Secret`, as well as an indication to the url pattern we should use (`https://app.speckle.systems/authn/verify/{appId}/{challenge}`).\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nNote that the `redirect url` points to our local computer network. When deploying this app to a service like Netlify, we\\'ll have to create a new one pointing to the correct Netlify url.\\n\\n#### [#](#saving-app-credentials-as-env-variables)\\n Saving app credentials as ENV variables\\n\\nThe `App Id` and `App Secret` are used to identify your app, so you should never add them to your version control. Instead, we\\'ll be using `ENV` variables to save that information, which also allows us to modify it in different scenarios (development/production).\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor those of you who wonder, frontend applications that integrate with the Speckle Server are treated as OAuth **public applications**, because they cannot keep their id and secret safe.\\n\\nVue will automatically read any `.env` files in the root of your project and load the variables accordingly, but will also replace all references with the actual value of the variable on compilation (which we **do not want**). We can tell `vue.js` to not do this by creating a file named `.env.local` instead. The contents should look like this 👇🏼 (remember to replace your ID and Secret appropriately).\\n\\n    # The Speckle Application Id\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_ID=YOUR_APP_ID \\n    \\n    # The Speckle Application Secret\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET\\n    \\n    VUE_APP_SERVER_URL=https://app.speckle.systems\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME=\"Speckle Demo App\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n### [#](#login-in-with-speckle)\\n Login in with Speckle\\n\\nA simplified version of the auth flow with a Speckle Server can be summarised as follows:\\n\\n1.  User clicks the Login button\\n2.  User is redirected to the auth page in the Speckle server (using the provided url pattern when creating an application)\\n3.  User will log in and allow the app to access their data (hopefully?).\\n4.  User is redirected to our specified `Redirect URL`, with an attached `access_code`.\\n5.  Using that access code, we can exchange it for a pair of `token/refresh token`, which is what allows the app to \"talk\" to the server as that user. We\\'ll save those in `localStorage`.\\n\\nThis may sound rather complicated, but it boils down to 2 different interactions (redirect your user and exchange the access code).\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-auth-functions-to-speckleutils-js)\\n Adding auth functions to `speckleUtils.js`\\n\\nIn our `src/speckleUtils.js` file, paste in the following code. You\\'ll find some constants that refer to our previously set `ENV` variables, as well as several functions.\\n\\n*   `goToSpeckleAuthPage`: Will generate a random challenge, save it in localStorage and direct the url to the auth page in the specified speckle server.\\n*   `exchangeAccessCode`: Will `fetch` from the server a new pair of `token/refresh token` and clear the `challenge`.\\n*   `speckleLogOut`: Will erase all necessary data from `localStorage`.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nNote that `goToSpeckleAuthPage` saves the challenge, and `exchangeAccessCode` uses that same challenge to exchange the tokens. If the challenge used doesn\\'t match, the request will fail.\\n\\nspeckleUtils.js\\n\\n    export const APP_NAME = process.env.VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME\\n    export const SERVER_URL = process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URL\\n    export const TOKEN = `${APP_NAME}.AuthToken`\\n    export const REFRESH_TOKEN = `${APP_NAME}.RefreshToken`\\n    export const CHALLENGE = `${APP_NAME}.Challenge`\\n    \\n    // Redirects to the Speckle server authentication page, using a randomly generated challenge.

Selecting one of the result items will change the selection text from `No stream selected` to display the selected Stream name and id, as well as 2 buttons. The first one will take you to the stream page in the server, while the second one will clear the selection in the app state.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-stream-search.641f64ce.gif)\\n\\n[#](#displaying-stream-commits)\\n Displaying stream commits\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo far, we\\'ve managed to authenticate with our Speckle server, fetch user and server information and search for available streams, as well as storing the results in our app state.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use our `selectedStream` to display a table with all it\\'s commits, as well as some data associated with each commit. Since the commit list can be rather large, we\\'ll be adding basic pagination functionality to the table.\\n\\nFor that, we\\'ll need to fetch the commit data associated with the stream, modify our `store/index.js` to hold that new data, and add a table view with a column filter on `Home.vue`\\n\\n### [#](#create-fetch-query)\\n Create fetch query\\n\\nLet\\'s start by adding a new query function to our `speckleQueries.js`\\n\\n    export const streamCommitsQuery = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) => `query {\\n        stream(id: \"${streamId}\"){\\n          commits(limit: ${itemsPerPage}, cursor: ${\\n      cursor ? \\'\"\\' + cursor + \\'\"\\' : null\\n    }) {\\n            totalCount\\n            cursor\\n            items{\\n              id\\n              message\\n              branchName\\n              sourceApplication\\n              referencedObject\\n              authorName\\n              createdAt\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }`\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nAnd add the following to `speckleUtils.js` (remember to import the `streamCommitsQuery`)\\n\\n    export const getStreamCommits = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) =>\\n      speckleFetch(streamCommitsQuery(streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor))\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nNotice that the query has a `cursor`. This is used to get successive _pages_ of the commits list. There is a current limitation with the cursor, as it only allows to go _forward_ in pages, not backward. To fix this, we\\'ll keep track of these values in our store so we can have pagination going forward (we\\'ll also keep the `itemsPerPage` value fixed to keep things simple).\\n\\n[#](#update-store-index-js)\\n Update `store/index.js`\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, there\\'s quite a bit of modifications in the `store/index.js` file. I\\'ve highlighted the changes in the code block, but feel free to replace the whole content for the one bellow.\\n\\nWe basically need modify the state to be able to:\\n\\n*   Store the `latestCommits` data, a list of `previousCursors` and a list of `tableOptions` for the table visualization.\\n*   Add mutations to modify individually each of these state properties (note that `previousCursors` is a list, so we added two mutations: one to push a new value and another to replace the entire list)\\n*   Add `getCommits` action, and update `logout`, `handleStreamSelection` and `clearStreamSelection` to also deal with these new props.\\n\\nstore/index.js\\n\\n    import Vue from \"vue\"\\n    import Vuex from \"vuex\"\\n    \\n    import {\\n      APP_NAME,\\n

highlighted the changes in the code block, but just as the step below, feel free to replace the entire content if you\\'re playing it fast and loose!\\n\\nWe need to do the following modifications:\\n\\n*   Add a new `div` for the table view containing a `v-select` and a `v-data-table`.\\n    *   The `v-select` allows to select the available keys to display as table columns\\n    *   The `v-data-table` does all the table UI magic so we don\\'t have to.\\n*   Add several computed properties:\\n    *   `commits` and `previousCursors` to fetch the data from our store\\n    *   `availableKeys` and `filteredHeaders` are helper functions to extract all available keys from the received commit data and format the headers the way `v-data-table` likes them.\\n*   Add new data properties to the component:\\n    *   `options` will serve to keep the table options in sync\\n    *   `selectedKeys` is where we\\'ll save the user selected information to display as columns in the table.

Go ahead to [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](https://localhost:8080)\\n. If logged in, your app should be looking like this 👇🏼\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-full-demo.1024d106.gif)\\n\\n[#](#adding-data-persistence)\\n Adding data persistence\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur app seems to be working fine, but there\\'s still a small adjustment that we can do to make things better. If, for any reason, a user reloads the page, they will loose their current stream selection + commit results, which is annoying. Let\\'s fix that!\\n\\nThankfully, we only need to modify the `store/index.js` file slightly to make this happen. We already installed `vuex-persist`, the plugin that will do all the heavy lifting for us.\\n\\nFirst, import vuex-persist:\\n\\n    import VuexPersistence from \"vuex-persist\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nthen create an instance (you\\'ll need to import `APP_NAME` from `speckleUtils.js`) that uses `localStorage`. We could also use `sessionStorage`, which would be deleted at the end of the session.\\n\\n    const vuexLocal = new VuexPersistence({\\n      storage: window.localStorage,\\n      key: `${APP_NAME}.vuex`\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nadd a `plugins` property to the `Vuex.Store` constructor config:\\n\\n    export default new Vuex.Store({\\n      plugins: [vuexLocal.plugin],\\n      ...\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nand that\\'s it! Your app should now persist the app state across page refresh. 🚀\\n\\n[#](#publish-to-netlify)\\n Publish to Netlify\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we have our app up and running locally, there\\'s just one last thing to do: deploy it!\\n\\nWe\\'ll be using Netlify for this guide, but you could also as easily use Heroku, or any other platforms that supports web-app s like Vue.js out of the box.\\n\\nFirst, you\\'ll need a GitHub account to push your app\\'s repo to, and a Netlify account. If you haven\\'t got a netlify account yet, you can log in with your GitHub account, which will make your life easier.\\n\\n### [#](#create-your-site)\\n Create your site\\n\\n1.  Go to your Netlify\\'s dashboard and find the `New site from Git` button ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site.88cb7d26.png)\\n2.  Follow the steps as shown:\\n    1.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-2.1f6bdff9.png)\\n    2.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-3.d288f521.png)\\n    3.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-4.ca2b8d4b.png)\\n    4.  Once this is done, you\\'ll have a netlify url where you\\'re app will live.\\n3.  Create a new Application on the Speckle server and set it\\'s callback url to the application url you just got from Netlify. This will give you a new `appId` and `appSecret`.\\n4.  Last step is to set the `env` variables, similar to how we did it for our development server.\\n    1.  Go to `Site Settings`\\\\->`Build and Deploy`\\\\-`Environment`\\n    2.  Add the same environment variables as in your `.env.local` file but using the `appId` and `appSecret` values from step 3. ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-env.167695cc.png)\\n5.  Go to the `Deploys` section of your app, find the `Trigger Deploy` button and select the `Deploy Site` option. This will force your app to restart and detect the new env variables.\\n\\nThat\\'s it! If you visit your netlify url, you should see your app running smoothly!\\n\\n[#](#wrapping-it-up)\\n Wrapping it up\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve covered quite a lot on this guide, but this was only a small example of interacting with Speckle streams and commits.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-the-base-object/782)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe Base object is one of the smallest, yet most critical parts of our SDKs as it influences the serialisation & deserialisation process, hashing speed & correctness, overall performance, and how elements are defined in the Speckleverse. It\\'s the building block of Speckle.\\n\\nIn this page we\\'ll describe what it is and how to use it in more detail. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#using-base)\\n Using `Base`\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe base object class (actually called `Base`) is the foundation of all data being transferred with Speckle. Any custom data structure that you want to transfer via Speckle should inherit from it. You can read more on creating your own schemas in the [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n\\n`Base` inherits from a C# dynamic object. This allows us to be strongly typed when needed, but as well fall back elegantly on dynamic properties when we want to, or need to. Imagine a crossover between a JavaScript object and a strongly defined C# class. It\\'s quite cool! Furthermore, this removes some of the friction in aligning with our Python and JS implementations.\\n\\nThis is what it looks like:\\n\\n    // Simplified class definition:\\n    public class Base {\\n    \\tpublic string id { get; set; } // this is the unique hash, generated from the serialized object\\n        \\tpublic string applicationId { get; set; } // a secondary (optional) identity value, for example the host application object id\\n    \\tpublic string speckle_type { get; } // this is the discriminator comprised of assembly name and inheritance\\n    \\tpublic long totalChildrenCount { get; } // this is the total number of detachable objects\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n### [#](#direct-usage)\\n Direct Usage\\n\\nHere\\'s how you would use a \"raw\" `Base` object as a custom data structure. It\\'s essentially just a dynamic object at heart.\\n\\n    var myObject = new Base();\\n    \\n    // setting properties using dot notation requires cast to dynamic\\n    ((dynamic)myObject).myNewProperty = \"foo\";\\n    \\n    // alternatively, just pretend it\\'s a dictionary!\\n    myObject[\"myNewProperty2\"] = \"bar\";\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nYou can define singular objects like this - like something representing a built element; alternatively you can define your own object collection types based on the source application you\\'re working from.\\n\\n    var myCommit = new Base();\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A\"] = new List<Base>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-B\"] = new List<Point>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A:RhinoLayer-C\"] = new List<String>() { ... };\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n✋ All property names will need to be serializable and some characters prevent this. With dot notation this is more obvious, but using the dictionary method, invalid prop names will only show up at serialization time. There is a helper function `IsPropNameValid` within `DynamicBase` that you could use to check whenever you are dealing with handling indeterminate properties from other software. It also checks for double special characters or overwritten instance property names.\\n\\n### [#](#inherited-usage)\\n Inherited Usage\\n\\nOf course, you can define custom classes that inherit from `Base` and define strongly typed properties in there, which can then be accessed as usual; these can easily coexist alongside dynamic ones.\\n\\n    public class Point : Base {\\n      // define a set of strongly typed properties\\n      public double x { get; set; }\\n      public double y { get; set; }\\n      public double z { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Strongly typed props behave as you would expect them to:\\n    var myPt = new Point();\\n    myPt.x = 10;\\n    var whatIsX = myPt.x;\\n    \\n    // With a dynamic property, things are a bit more verbose, but still manageable:\\n    ((dynamic)myPt).bar = \"baz\";\\n    var whatIsBar = ((dynamic)myPt).bar as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    // Alternative syntax, if you actually pass the property name at runtime:\\n    var whatIsBar = myPt[\"bar\"] as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nSetting a dynamic property that overlaps with a strongly typed one will actually just set the strongly typed one 🙂\\n\\nAll kit object models are inheriting from the `Base` object class for their object definitions. This ensures that Speckle will be able to transport them!\\n\\n[#](#detaching)\\n Detaching @\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen defining your dynamic `Base` object properties, you can detach them by prepending an `@` to your property name like so:\\n\\n    public class Foo : Base { }\\n    public class Bar : Base { }\\n    \\n    var foo = new Foo();\\n    var bar = new Bar();\\n    \\n    foo[\"@bar\"] = bar;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nDetaching a property stores that property value as a reference to another object. Why do this? Since it\\'s possible to nest your `Base` inherited class objects, detaching any properties that may be assigned an object used by other objects keeps your data squeaky clean. Since detached objects are only serialized once during transport, detaching when appropriate means faster sending and receiving times as well ⚡\\n\\nFor a more in depth rundown of detachables and examples, check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#hashing)\\n Hashing\\n----------------------\\n\\nAs you may or may not know, objects in Speckle are immutable. That means that if you change a property of one, it essentially gets a whole new identity; it\\'s a whole new object (as far as the storage layer is concerned). This immutability is enforced through unique hashes that are dependent on the object\\'s properties.\\n\\nAs a developer, you don\\'t need to care about all this 🙌. Our SDKs takes care of correctly setting the hash of an object, at the correct time: at the end of the serialisation process. There\\'s another purely cosmetic change that we made: the hash is now stored in an field called `id`. Why? Mostly so it\\'s clear that it\\'s the single object identity mechanism that **should** be used across all storage layers.\\n\\nWhat about operations that are dependent on hashes? From our analysis of existing programmatic usage, you rarely really need the hash of an object before serialising (and, implicitly, storing it somewhere). When retrieving objects from \"somewhere\" (more on this in another post), the hash already exists, so you can check against an existing application state and manage updates.\\n\\n    var x = myObject.id; // will be populated only if this object has been previously serialised!\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIf you really need the hash (id!) before serialising it, don\\'t panic! You can still generate it - nevertheless we\\'ve put that behind an explicit function call so you, as a developer, are aware of the extra cost that you will be incurring. Here\\'s how the signature of that function looks like:\\n\\n    /// <summary>\\n    /// Gets the id (a unique hash) of this object. ⚠️ This method fully serializes the object, which in the case of large objects (with many sub-objects), has a tangible cost.\\n    /// <para><b>Hint:</b> Objects that are retrieved/pulled from a server/local cache do have an id (hash) property pre-populated.</para>\\n    /// <para><b>Note:</b>The hash of a decomposed object differs from the hash of a non-decomposed object.</para>\\n    /// </summary>\\n    /// <param name=\"decompose\">If true, will decompose the object in the process of hashing.</param>\\n    /// <returns></returns>\\n    public string GetId(bool decompose = false) { }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nNoticed that `decompose` flag? You\\'re sharp - check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n for more.\\n\\n[#](#the-speckle-objects-kit)\\n The Speckle Objects Kit\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur SDKs come with our in-house Objects Kit comprised of `Base` inherited classes for your standard AEC needs. The core geometry kit contains all your basic elements like Points, Lines, Curves, and Breps, which are then used as properties for our more extensively defined BIM, Structural, and Civil elements. Read more in our [Objects section](/dev/objects)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#displaying-base)\\n Displaying `Base`\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to the `Base` properties in our model above, you may also encounter certain common properties when exploring your data in our web viewer. The objects in our Objects Kit come with properties that we use to display them in our frontend:\\n\\n    // Class definition with additional display properties\\n    public class Foo : Base {\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; } // Mesh objects that represent the geometry of this Base object, e.g. used to render surfaces, or solid objects in our viewer\\n    \\t// or\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic Polyline displayValue { get; set; } // a polyline used to render complex curve objects in our viewer\\n    \\t\\n    \\tpublic Box bbox { get; set; } // a bounding box used to assist with object selection in our viewer\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is a **special property** within the Objects kit. It is common for classes inheriting `Base` to represent complex, conceptual, or domain specific objects. The `displayValue` property can be used to provide a **geometric representation** to help display the object in applications that don\\'t have a native form.\\n\\nFor example, When receiving **BIM types** like `Wall`, `Floor`, `Beam`, etc into a **non-BIM application** like Rhino, Unity, or our web viewer, these applications **have no way of rendering these elements natively**. The `displayValue` property represents **fallback** geometry, that will automatically be used by applications when receiving types without a native conversion.\\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is expected to be either an **object inheriting `Base`** or a **`List` of objects inheriting `Base`**. Ideally, these types **should be simple geometry types** like `Mesh` or `Polyline` as these can be converted in all (or almost all) receiving applications (However, this rule isn\\'t enforced for custom `Base` objects, and in theory, any type inheriting `Base` can be used .)\\n\\n[#](#collections)\\n Collections\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhether to represent Layers, Categories, Tags, Collections, Groups, or hierarchical containers, it is common to see a natural grouping of objects within a 3D model. The `Collection` type provides a unified way to represent hierarchical collections of Speckle objects in a queryable, filterable way and is useful for interoperability between applications.\\n\\nA collection object only has three properties (in addition to those inherited from the `Base` Speckle object) and is completely kit/domain agnostic.\\n\\n> `name` - Any (non-empty) human-readable `string` name, one not necessarily unique.\\n> \\n> `collectionType` - Any `string` value describing the type of collection, used for convenience, and specific interop.\\n> \\n> `elements` - A `List<Base>` representing child objects, may include nested `Collection` objects.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur new front-end (fe2) is designed to display `Collection` in the scene explorer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/fe2-collections.4509cd2c.gif)\\n\\nSuppose we look at how Collection objects are used inside Speckle versions. We see within the Collection’s `elements` property; we can expect any objects to be nested, including sub-collections.\\n\\nImportantly, however, we only see `Collection` objects nested under other `Collections`. Unlike other speckle objects which may form any [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n structure, Collections must be in a true directed tree structure.\\n\\n> ![](/assets/img/collection-tree-structure.2601314c.png)\\n> \\n> Diagram of collections within a Speckle commit, illustrating collections can contain both sub-collections and other objects under the `elements` property. While the `elements` property of geometry objects do not contain Collections\\n\\nWith the exception of the Revit connector, connectors will send `Collection`s from the layer/tag/collection structure.\\n\\n| Rhino | Blender | Sketchup |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| ![](/assets/img/rhino-collections.cbb5593a.png) | ![](/assets/img/blend-collections.a23747e7.png) | ![](/assets/img/skp-collections.26fa690d.png) |\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/base.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Architecture](/dev/architecture.html) [Decomposition API](/dev/decomposition.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'The Base Object | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/base'}),\n",

You\\'ll be ready to make the most out of what Speckle has to offer.\\n\\nYou will know how you could create your own backend to Speckle, how data flows and how you can control those flows, how data is stored, as well as how applications interact with Speckle and can use it as a data persistence framework.\\n\\nSpeckle is the open source data platform built for the AEC industry. What does this platform do? Put simply, Speckle consists of a set of infrastructural components needed to **store** and **retrieve** data.\\n\\n### [#](#data)\\n Data\\n\\nSome of these applications are authoring tools - such as Revit and Rhino - and other applications are SPA web apps, other more fully fledged backend apps - including scripts, serverless functions, etc.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/unfold.e179bf8d.png)\\n\\nThese applications, in order to talk to each other and make sense of the data they are consuming, need to speak a common language. The design and principles of this common language are centred around **composability** and **extensibility,** and **not** around **completeness**. This makes Speckle much more approachable than, for example, IFC.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\n[Here\\'s an article](/dev/base)\\n through how we implemented this approach in our .NET SDK.\\n\\n[#](#kits)\\n Kits\\n----------------\\n\\nA Speckle kit is, essentially, the definition of a common language: a schema. Moreover, a Speckle kit also contains the translation routines to and from an application\\'s native object model to the kit\\'s schema. Kits are \"hot-swappable\": Speckle comes with one by default which delivers the core of our interoperability capabilities. Nevertheless, anyone can define their own kit to serve their purpose.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/kits.e6428454.png)\\n\\nExisting authoring applications, such as Rhino, Revit, Autocad, send and receive data from and to Speckle by passing it through the conversion routines of a given kit. This is handled through **connectors.** Connectors are plugins that integrate within these host applications (e.g., the Rhino Connector) and allow end-users to select the data they want to send to Speckle, and, behind the scenes, convert it and, lastly, transport it to Speckle.\\n\\nExtra Reading\\n\\nRead more about **kits** [here](/dev/kits)\\n. If curious, you can also follow up with the discussion on [our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/introducing-kits-2-0/710)\\n.\\n\\nWe also have a guide on how to write your own **connector** - [check it out](/dev/connectors-dev.html)\\n!\\n\\nOther applications do not necessarily need to do so: they can directly use a kit\\'s schema - or simply use objects that respect the few low-level constraints that Speckle needs to serve its purpose. These aspects are described below in [Serialisation & Structure](#serialisation-structure)\\n. Next, we\\'re going to discuss how the serialisation layer interacts with the storage layer.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-storage)\\n Serialisation and Storage\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce Speckle data is translated or directly created, it needs to be serialised and, lastly, stored. In reverse, data needs to be retrieved from the storage layer and de-serialised to a memory representation that can be used by the application it was received in (either converted back to host application representations, or consumed by the business logic of the app. During the process of serialisation, Speckle also needs to decompose objects into their constituent parts; similarly, it needs to re-compose them during the de-serialisation process.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/serialisation.7d9aa653.png)\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper into Speckle\\'s decomposition and re-composition procedures, we will first take a look at how the storage layer is handled in Speckle and the flexibility it offers.\\n\\n[#](#transports)\\n Transports\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDifferent storage systems have various characteristics that make them better (or more ill) suited for different scenarios. This is why, rather than employ a unique storage system, Speckle uses an intermediary abstraction layer: transports. A transport defines the way Speckle writes to, and reads from, a given persistence layer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/transports.65882822.png)\\n\\nOne such transport is the Speckle Server Transport. Another transport is an SQLite Transport. Speckle comes with a couple of other transports too: a MongoDB transport, an In-Memory Transport, as well as a Disk Transport. Other transports, such as an S3 transport, a MySQL transport could easily be developed.\\n\\nThe Disk Transport writes and reads your Speckle data from files in a location you specify, while the SQLite Transport does the same, but backed by a SQLite database. For example, the latter is used extensively throughout our connectors as a local cache so as to reduce the dependency on a high-latency transport, namely the one for the Speckle Server.\\n\\nTransports offer developers low-level flexibility in developing, essentially, their own custom back-ends to Speckle, or pushing data to other systems that can do different things - even a whole new Speckle Server.\\n\\nMoreover, send operations are no longer restricted to one single location: Speckle allows you to send data, in parallel, to multiple transports. For example, data can be sent to two different Server Transports at the same time, one being an internal server and one being an external one - a different stakeholder involved in the process.\\n\\nAlternatively, a plugin based on Speckle could be developed that acts much more like git, writing data to a local folder that resides right next to the source file itself. This enables, in whatever configuration you see fit, a local only usage of Speckle, with pushing to remotes being a secondary, optional operation.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\nA work-in-progress guide on how to write your own transport can be found [here](transports-dev)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-structure)\\n Serialisation and Structure\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore data can be persisted to a storage system, it needs to be serialised. Serialisation is the process by which an object is converted into a state that can be stored or transmitted, and be reconstructed later from (deserialisation).\\n\\nObjects are, by their nature, structured data. The object graph and, implicitly, its structure, gives it meaning. Serialising a whole object graph in a naive way would result into a large blob which would be difficult to work with, and exclude certain workflows - such as reading just subsets of the graph, or individual objects - without deserialising the whole structure first. Storage systems, such as databases, work best with what we call \"flat\" data: individual rows, each corresponding to a given object.\\n\\nSpeckle solves this structural impedance mismatch by deconstructing an object into its individual constituent parts during the process of serialisation. These individual objects are then sent for storage to any given transports.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/deconstruction.c0422666.png)\\n\\nEach object, when serialised, gets a unique id which is generated by hashing its value. This means that all objects are immutable: if they change throughout their lifecycle, they get a new hash.\\n\\nThese object hashes are also used to assemble, for each individual object, its internal graph references. What this means, essentially, is that each Speckle object contains the information needed for reconstructing its full graph of descendants - alongside its own data.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/reconstruction.4927e890.png)\\n\\nAt the heart of `git` there are two types of objects: trees and blobs. Blobs represent the files themselves, and trees represent the file structure. **Objects in Speckle are, essentially, both a tree and a blob at the same time** - the \"blob\" being the value of the object itself, and the tree representing its object graph. While git sources its tree from the folder structure of your project, Speckle sources it from the object graph itself.\\n\\nWhen deserialising data, Speckle reconstructs it at the same time. This means that data can reside and make use of the upsides of storage systems such as relational databases, while at the same time, developers are not constrained as to how they structure it and can continue working with it freely inside their applications.\\n\\nAnother important note is that Speckle uses JSON as the native serialisation format for the object \"blobs\".

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-decomposition-api/911)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers how Speckle deals with the structure and composition of design data. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#blobs-and-trees)\\n Blobs and Trees\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nDesign and construction data is mostly relational: **built elements link to each other.** Despite this, there is no canonical way of structuring it. How do they relate to each other? Well, it depends!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/cb099e4d3a8553053869d791f0ce1fcaebca3c7a_2_690x295.png)\\n\\nFor example, a `Site` object may contain one or more `Building` objects. These, in turn, may contain one more `Levels`, and each of these `Levels` may contain some `Walls`, `Floor` and `Beam` elements. Or, those `Building` objects may each individually reference the same `Site`. Within the `Building` object, there\\'s all the `Walls` and `Beams`, and each of them, rather than being grouped under a `Level`, they individually reference a specific `Level`.\\n\\nIn order to solve this, we\\'ve taken a good look at how git, the ubiquitous version control system, works. Git operates with two object types: blobs and trees. Blobs represent files, and an important characteristic is that they are immutable - just like objects are in Speckle. Trees represent folders, and they are used to track the hierarchy of the folder structure of your repository.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you think this analogy hints to more, you\\'re right: Speckle is becoming a fully fledged version control system for design data. Keep an eye out 😎\\n\\nAs opposed to Git, that deals with data structured on your hard drive, Speckle deals with data structured in memory. In Speckle, an object is, at the same time, both a blob (data) and a tree (its subcomponents). There are two separate, yet interweaved, problems (and their corollaries) that I\\'ll now address:\\n\\n*   How to decompose an object? _(Corollary: how to recompose an object?)_\\n*   How to serialise, transport and store that decomposed object? _(Corollary: how to retrieve and deserialise an object?)_\\n\\n[#](#decomposing)\\n Decomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong way to structure design data. Different applications operate with different models, different use-cases require different hierarchies, different disciplines and professionals operate with differently structured ontologies.\\n\\nSpeckle now has a mechanism by which, in the process of specifying an object - either via a strongly typed kit, or via dynamic properties - developers (and end-users) can decide what gets decomposed and what doesn\\'t.\\n\\n### [#](#strongly-typed-detachment)\\n Strongly Typed Detachment\\n\\nIt works, in the case of strongly typed properties, by adding the Speckle specific attribute `[DetachProperty]` on the properties you want to store as references, rather than within the object itself.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s take an imaginary set of classes:\\n\\n    public class Building : Base {\\n      [DetachProperty] // this attribute tells Speckle to store the value of the Site separately.\\n      public Site Site { get; set; }\\n      public List<Level> Levels { get; set; }\\n      public Owner { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public class Level : Base {\\n      public double height { get; set; } = 3.2;\\n      public double baseElevation {get; set; } = 0;\\n    \\n      [DetachProperty]\\n      public List<Base> Elements { get; set; } // The actual walls, floors, columns, etc.\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Define a site globally\\n    var mySite = new Site();\\n    \\n    // Reference the same site in both buildings.\\n    buildingA.Site = mySite;\\n    buildingB.Site = mySite;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nWhen an instance of the Building class gets saved, the `Site` will be stored separately. If two Buildings share the same `Site`, it will be stored only once, and each instance of the `Building` class will hold a reference to the same `Site`.\\n\\nIn our example, each Level can hold, in a _detachable_ property, all its walls, beams, ducts, pipes, furniture, and other built elements. Consequently, each of these elements will be individually accessible from the storage layer, and will maintain topological unity. Why is this important? Let\\'s imagine a building with a series of levels separated by floor slabs. **The slab between two levels pertains to which level: the bottom one, or the top one?**\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/original/1X/3ea9d660024d5f3545933133165737e063fa87d5.png)\\n\\nCollections\\n\\nThe most generic class used in Speckle is the `Collection` class. The `Collection` class is a `Base` class that has the `elements` property, which is a `List<Base>`. This means that any object that inherits from `Base` can be stored in a `Collection` object. This is a very powerful concept, as it allows us to store arbitrary data structures in Speckle, without paying any penalties. While it is mostly used for representing parent-child relationships, those children can be of any type, and because `elements` is detached they can also be stored in multiple collections.\\n\\n### [#](#dynamic-detachment)\\n Dynamic Detachment\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this through an example that also demonstrates how dynamically added properties can be detached. We\\'ll assume that we will dynamically set `topSlab` and `bottomSlab` properties to each level in our imaginary object model:\\n\\n    // We\\'re grossly simplifying in this example. Here are our two building levels:\\n    var level_1, level_2;\\n    \\n    // The philosophical slab instance. Does it belong to level 1 or level 2?\\n    var slab_between_1_and_2 = new Slab();\\n    \\n    // Well, it belongs to both! Notice the \"@\" character at the beginning of\\n    // the dynamic property assignment - it\\'s the Speckle convention for \"detaching\"\\n    // dynamically added properties.\\n    level_1[\"@topSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    level_2[\"@bottomSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nBecause we\\'ve prepended the property name with an \"@\" symbol, Speckle will now \"detach\" it. Consequently, once stored, both level one and two will now hold a reference to a single slab! Beyond storage efficiency - the slab is only stored once - **this approach gives us the freedom to structure data however is best and, simultaneously, query, slice and dice it however we need to.**\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s assume you need to do a quantity takeoffs:\\n\\n*   For each each individual level: specify the total surface area, including walls, ceilings, etc. Solution: simply retrieve each level individually!\\n*   For the whole building: calculate the total volume of concrete that goes into the slabs. Solution: just query the building object for all the slabs!\\n\\nSimilarly, imagine you\\'ve written a script that does environmental analysis on a given level. The level can now be retrieved in its entirety - without juggling around to bring in the level above it too, just to get the ceiling out. Once the results are calculated, they can be stored in a detachable property on that specific level (e.g., `level_1[@\"solarComfortMeshWithColours\"] = analysisResultMesh;`). Later down the line in your workflow, one can could query for all the \"`solarComfortMeshWithColours`\" objects individually for each level, or, if needed, for the whole building.\\n\\n[#](#recomposing)\\n Recomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nRecomposition of an object happens within the deserialisation process, and it\\'s tightly integrated with the transport layer. The process, on the surface, is deceivingly simple. When you ask Speckle to receive a specific object, the process is as follows:\\n\\n*   Speckle retrieves said object\\'s \"blob\" (actually a JSON string representation of it),\\n*   Next up, Speckle retrieves at all the reference tree of this object,\\n*   Speckle proceeds to deserialise and re-compose the parent object, inserting in the place of references the actual referenced object.\\n\\nWether or not this sounds complicated, the exposed API is actually rather simple and the end result is that a decomposed object, when received back, will be identical with the original one - with all its parts in place 💥\\n\\n[#](#chunking)\\n Chunking\\n------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#problem)\\n Problem\\n\\nSome list properties of various objects can get very large. Examples:\\n\\n*   a Brep with many faces will have a Surfaces list prop containing 1000s of potentially heavy Surfaces.\\n*   a mesh with 100k+ vertices and faces.\\n\\nThis results in a clunky (memory heavy) serialisation process and can be unsafe (read: cause breakages) due to memory limitations.\\n\\n### [#](#solutions)\\n Solutions\\n\\nIn order of preference. Note that they are not exclusive, and they build on top of each other:\\n\\n*   First, optimise the list property so it\\'s more lightweight\\n*   Second, chunk the list property\\n\\n### [#](#first-port-of-call-optimise-the-list-property-🧪)\\n First Port of Call: Optimise the List Property 🧪\\n\\nFor example, you might be tempted to define a mesh like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        public List<Point> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nA much more efficient way is to define it like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n      // Typed array of 3\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\nInstead of storing each individual vertex as a point, you store them in a typed array. Serialisation will be much faster and leaner.\\n\\n### [#](#second-port-of-call-use-the-chunkable-attribute-🆕)\\n Second Port of Call: Use the `Chunkable` Attribute 🆕\\n\\nIn some cases you might be too lazy to actually optimise the storage of a list property, or it might be too convenient to use the class itself.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might still have a simple `List<double>` that expands to millions+ of items, like in the case of a very large mesh.\\n\\nIn the cases above, the best way is to mark the property as `Chunkable` together with `[DetachProperty]`. This will tell the serialiser that it should split it into manageable chunks of items, the size of which you can control.\\n\\nHere\\'s how that looks like currently in the mesh class:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> faces { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> colors { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> textureCoordinates { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nPotential Footguns\\n\\nThe DetachProperty attribute by itself can be a performance footgun in some scenarios: for example, if you have a `List<Point>` that can grow really big and you mark it as detachable, without marking it as chunkable, each individual point in that list will be stored as a separate entity.\\n\\nThis is bad: serialisation and deserialisation will take longer, and it essentially amounts to bad object model design (in speckle terms of course).\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nEnd users and developers can now productively control the way they structure their design data through the decomposition mechanism. From the point of view of the future Speckle connectors, this will enable us to expose object model flexibility in a more elegant way than before to end users. As developers, Speckle gives you another powerful API on top of which you can scaffold your digital automation workflows.\\n\\nMore importantly, this allows you to store arbitrary data structures (scaffolded on top of a `Base`) with Speckle, without paying any penalties: **Speckle deals equally well with flat and nested data.**\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/decomposition.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [The Base Object](/dev/base.html) [Kits](/dev/kits.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Decomposition API | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/decomposition'}),\n",

If multiple kits are available on a user machine, the user (or system administrators) will be responsible of selecting the default kit.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\nWhen a connector needs to convert an object, it will only search for available conversion routines in the selected kit and will not automatically fall back on other kits - this might change in the future!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f9890eead0fb8aa7bbe141a6cf7dd16453b0d176_2_690x449.png)\\n\\n[#](#objects)\\n Objects\\n----------------------\\n\\nObjects is the name of our default kit.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-transports/919)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers what Transports are and do and the basic concepts behind them. [Here can read how to write your own transport](/dev/transports-dev)\\n. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most common use-cases we\\'ve encountered throughout the past 5 years of interacting with developers from the AEC space is \"dumping data somewhere\", and, obviously, getting it back out again. While this can, of course, be done by using the Speckle server, some situations call for a different storage type or database. We\\'ve seen people looking to use files on a network drive, Azure SQL provisions, MongoDB, Excel files, and sometimes [core rope memory (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory)\\n (joking, we\\'ve never seen that one - yet!).\\n\\nAn important part of our mission at Speckle is to empower developers across AEC. We want to give you a leg up so you can \"automate all the things\" and build powerful applications that leverage modern tech.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports give developers in the AEC space full control over where and how their data is stored.\\n\\nYou can now switch, choose and mix various storage layers. This allows us to write better, more memory efficient and predictable connectors. It also allows you, as a developer, to use Speckle as a springboard in your development work in a much more flexible way.\\n\\n[#](#definitions)\\n Definitions\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we dive in and see how they work, let\\'s get some definitions out of the way:\\n\\n### [#](#transports-2)\\n Transports\\n\\nIn Speckle, transports take Speckle Objects from memory and persist it to a specific storage layer. Of course, they\\'re also responsible for taking those objects out of the storage layer and back into memory.\\n\\n### [#](#storage-layers)\\n Storage Layers\\n\\nThe storage layer that a transport writes to can be, ultimately, anything you want it to be. The .NET SDK implements already a few of them, specifically:\\n\\n*   an SQLite Transport\\n*   an In-Memory Transport\\n*   **a Speckle Server 2.0 Transport**\\n*   a Disk Transport\\n*   a MongoDB Transport\\n\\nOther possible targets for transports can be S3 storage, a network drive, etc. You can also write a transport that writes to more than one place, but we advise against it - the .NET SDK provides a better way to achieve the same thing.\\n\\nMoreover, in the case of disk based transports (ie, disk, sqlite, etc.) you can also **control the location** of where this data is stored.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data-serialisation-and-writing)\\n Sending Data: Serialisation and Writing\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSerialisation is a potentially quite wasteful operation depending on the size of the data. One of our goals is to be able to support arbitrarily large models without adding too much overhead.\\n\\n> Why can serialisation be wasteful, especially in terms of memory usage? Imagine you have a model with 100k building objects (geometry & data) open in an application. To send that model to Speckle, we would need to (1) convert those objects into Speckle objects, using a given converter, then (2) serialise them to whatever format we\\'d be ingesting down the line (e.g., a JSON string), and, finally, (3) transport them to Speckle. Over the course of these steps, your computer\\'s memory holds **_three_** representations of the same object - Native, Speckle, and String. Not that cool! To reduce memory overhead, Speckle now integrates serialisation with writing objects to one or more persistence layers via transports. Whenever an object finishes serialisation, it\\'s sent to a transport for storage, and ultimately, its string representation gets \"garbage collected\". Just like this, we\\'ve knocked off some memory usage.\\n\\nThe 2.0 API exposes two lower level methods for sending (serialising and writing) and receiving (reading and deserialising) data. In this section, we\\'ll look at only at the send one - the section below will provide more detail on receiving data.\\n\\nFirst off, let\\'s start with the simplest, default, use case:\\n\\n    // First, let\\'s create a simple base object to store our building data in.\\n    var myData = new Base();\\n    myData[\"@columns\"] = new List<Columns>() { ... the columns };\\n    myData[\"@rooms\"] = new List<Rooms>() { ... the rooms};\\n    \\n    // Let\\'s now send the data:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nLooks quite simple! In this scenario, the `Send` method serialised and saved the `myData` object, together with all its detachable `columns` and `rooms` to the default Speckle local transport (an SQLite db stored in `~/AppData/Speckle`), and returned the id (hash) of the `myData` object, which you can use to receive it back again.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at a more advanced example:\\n\\n    var myRevisionId = await Operations.Send(\\n    \\tmyData,\\n    \\ttransports: new ITransport[] {\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // imagine this one server...\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // ... and this is a different one! you\\'re basically pushing to multiple remotes!\\n    \\t  new MyCustomTransport( args ) // ... and, why not another transport?\\n      }\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening here is that we\\'re passing in multiple transports to the Send method. Speckle will persist the given object, with all its detachable sub-children, to all these transports, and, when done, return the object\\'s id (hash!).\\n\\n[#](#receiving-data-reading-and-deserialisation)\\n Receiving Data: Reading and Deserialisation\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, let\\'s start with the simplest use-case possible:\\n\\n    // To set the stage, in the previous code sample, we\\'ve done:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n    // Now, we want to get it back out. It\\'s as simple as:\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive( myDataId );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nThis just retrieves the object back using the default SQLite Transport. No accounts, no extra HTTP requests, no hassle. Of course, this is enough only for \"local\" operations that are bound to a single computer only.\\n\\nIf you want this to work across a local network, you can always create a SQLite Transport (or your own custom transport for that matter) that stores data on a network accessible drive. For large collaborative environments, you can, of course, receive your data from a Speckle Server.\\n\\nWhile you can Send data to multiple places at the same time, you can\\'t really receive data from more places at the same time. Hence, `Receive` can only accept one transport as the source:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n    \\tmyDataId,\\n    \\tremoteTransport: new ServerTransport( ... ) // where you want to receive things from!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nDone! `myData` is now your data - a nicely deserialised Base object.\\n\\n[#](#advanced-transports)\\n Advanced Transports\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Send and Receive functions in the examples above assume **a shared global cache** located in `~/User/.config/Speckle`. In the case of Send, this means that objects will be written to a SQLite Transport that is used by Speckle always; in the case of Receive, the same SQLite Transport will be used to buffer to/from the remote transport.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are some use cases where you don\\'t want to, or cannot, use the shared global cache. For example, you would want to go full on classic version control, and store your history right next to your project\\'s file:\\n\\n    `-- MyProject_A            # root folder\\n        |-- .speckle           # the \".git\" folder\\n        |   |-- references.db  # commits, branches, tags, etc. storage\\n        |   `-- objects.db     # object storage\\n        `-- MyProject_A.rvt    # source file\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nHow would you actually implement such a system?\\n\\nFirst, you can always customise the location of your transport. For example, in the case of the SQLite Transport, you can specify a folder where to actually create it. Let\\'s assume we want to send our data to only two transports, a local SQLite one that\\'s sitting in the `.speckle` folder just next to our Revit file, and a Speckle Server.\\n\\n    var customLocalTransport = new SQLiteTransport( basePath: @\"{localFolderPath}/.speckle\" );\\n    var serverTransport = new ServerTransport(...);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThe `Send` method can take an optional `useDefaultCache: false` argument to bypass the global cache, and send exclusively to the provided transports:\\n\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send(\\n      myData,\\n      transports: new ITransport[] { customLocalTransport, serverTransport },\\n      useDefaultCache: false // will bypass the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nWhen receiving data, if you want to use your custom local transport, the method would look like this:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId: myDataId,\\n      remoteTransport: serverTransport,\\n      localTransport: customLocalTransport // will use this one instead of the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nAnother use case is in constrained environments, where you don\\'t have a persistent storage layer handy, such as a serverless function, or docker container. That\\'s where you would probably want to use a `MemoryTransport` - it\\'s obviously much faster and it doesn\\'t need to touch the disk.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nTransports give you, as a developer, a lot of flexibility in how you can use Speckle, so hopefully \"automating all the things\" will become a bit easier and nicer. They make it easy to customise your workflows and where and how you store data - from the Speckle Server, to one or more databases, local or remote.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/transports.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 8/1/2021, 10:56:30 AM\\n\\n← [Kits](/dev/kits.html) [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Transports | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/transports'}),\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/apps-authn-speckle-2-0/961)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a quick post on how authentication with the server works; we\\'ve put in _a lot_ of effort to make it easier for developers to extend the functionality of Speckle in their own apps, and simultaneously more secure for end users.\\n\\nBefore we start, we\\'d like to clarify that this post refers to specifically **authentication**, and not authorization.\\n\\n*   Authorization (authZ) controls **who has access to what resource**; it\\'s not the focus of this post.\\n*   Authentication (authN) controls **how a user can delegate access to other applications** (pieces of software) that then act on their behalf.\\n\\n[#](#api-tokens)\\n API Tokens\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAll access to the API is done through bearer tokens that need to present in the Authorization header of each request. There are several ways to create/obtain these tokens, which we\\'ll describe below. First, a few important notes on _tokens in general_:\\n\\n### [#](#token-scopes)\\n Token Scopes\\n\\nEach token has a set of associated scopes to it which **limit what actions it can do**. For example, you could have a token that is only allowed to read streams and your profile information. Alternatively, you could have a token that is allowed to search for other users on the server, read your existing streams, create new ones, etc.\\n\\nAs Speckle will grow with functionality, new scopes will be made available. Currently there are:\\n\\n    let coreModuleScopes = [\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"server:setup\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Edit server information.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your api tokens.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:write\",\\\\\\n        description: `Create and delete api tokens on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:read\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Read your streams & and any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:write\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Create streams on your behalf and read your streams & any associated information (any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read your profile information`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:email\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your email.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read other users\\' profile on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:email\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Access the emails of other users.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n    ];\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n\\n### [#](#token-lifetime)\\n Token Lifetime\\n\\nTokens also have a certain lifetime after which they\\'re no longer valid. This helps with automatically blocking access to long forgotten apps. Written a little script two years ago that you\\'ve totally forgot about, but the token\\'s nicely pasted in the codebase since you\\'ve never published it? Well, now that\\'s safe even if someone else somehow snitches it - it probably expired.\\n\\n[#](#personal-access-tokens)\\n Personal Access Tokens\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs a developer, you can now create personal access tokens that you can use to delegate access to your script on your behalf, similar to how Github\\'s [Personal Access Tokens (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\\n work.\\n\\nWhen you create them, you can assign assign to them whatever scopes & lifetime you want to, just remember to limit both to the minimum to be _safe._\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTo create a new token head over `YOUR-SPECKLE-SERVER\\\\profile`\\n\\n[#](#apps)\\n Apps\\n----------------\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/109046703-f45be080-76cc-11eb-83b3-27ed956ff319.png)\\n\\nOnce you\\'re beyond the hacking phase, you\\'ll probably want to create & publish a speckle app that others can use. As a developer, you can:\\n\\n*   register apps that others can use (or not),\\n*   manage the apps you have created - edit name, description, redirect url, scopes, and delete.\\n\\nOnce an app is registered on a server, users can now delegate access to it for the set of scopes that the developer registered for that application. Once the delegation process is successful - the user approves it - they will get redirected to the url that the developer specified.\\n\\nOf course, as an end user, you have full control and visibility on the apps you have authorized. You can:\\n\\n*   see all your authorized apps (apps that you have granted access to),\\n*   revoke access to any of the above,\\n*   check out any publicly listed apps on this server (optional at this stage)\\n\\n### [#](#extras-on-app-types)\\n Extras on app types:\\n\\nNote: broadly speaking, there are two type of apps:\\n\\n*   Apps that act on behalf of a user - **supported ✅**\\n*   Apps that can act with their own identity - **not currently supported ⏱**\\n\\nWe\\'ll write soon more documentation on how the authentication flow with the Server actually works. For the geeks out there, here\\'s a short summary, or some important points:\\n\\n*   We are supporting the **authorization\\\\_code** flow with **PKCE** only for public and confidential clients.\\n*   We do not support dynamic scope requests for apps. We **only support pre-registered scopes for each app**.\\n*   If an app is edited in any way - name, scopes, etc. - all its tokens get revoked and users will need to re-authorize it.\\n\\nClients are usually split into two categories: public and private. Public clients cannot realistically hold a secret, whereas private ones can. For example, a front-end only web application is a public client; same goes for the desktop connectors. A private client can be a server-side application, which can realistically store an application secret in, for example, a .env file or provide it during the CI/CD process.\\n\\nClients are protected by:\\n\\n*   Using exclusively a pre-registered redirect URL.\\n*   Native apps (desktop): registering a custom application scheme (`speckle://`).\\n*   PKCE (Proof of Key For Code Exchange).\\n*   a client id & client secret, but the clientSecret is superfluous in the case of public clients.\\n\\n[#](#examples)\\n Examples\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe 2.0 server already comes with two applications that demonstrate this flow (warning - there might still be bugs). These are:\\n\\n*   The main web frontend application - accessible at the server\\'s default url, and\\n*   The GraphQL explorer - accessible at your server\\'s url + `/explorer`.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve put a lot of work into making Speckle developer friendly and extensible - and apps are just a small part of that. We hope that writing Speckle Apps will be fun and effective, and we can\\'t wait to see what you\\'ll do with them!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/apps-auth.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Transports](/dev/transports.html) [Introduction](/dev/dotnet.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Apps and Auth | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/apps-auth'}),\n",

Without a method to navigate through complex, hierarchical data structures, you might end up with partial or incorrect data representations. Traversal provides a systematic way to explore Speckle data while capturing the relational context between objects.\\n\\nThe most basic way to consume Speckle objects is simply **[by flattening the Speckle data](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n**, and consuming objects one by one. For many use cases, this is all that is required, but often it is necessary to consume Speckle objects **while capturing the hierarchical context of objects**.\\n\\n**In connectors**, this means traversing received Speckle data **to find convertible objects and their children**. In these cases, we are converting more than just objects one by one, but also **preserving the hierarchical tree** of parent/child relationships.\\n\\nSo, What is Traversal?\\n\\nIn practical terms, Traversal is **how we navigate Speckle data** and the relationships between Speckle Objects, to **consume objects with hierarchical context.**\\n\\nTo be concise, traversal aims to transform the [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n topology (_Think of it as a one-way network of objects; no loops allowed_) of a Speckle data **into a pure [tree (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\\n topology** (_a branching hierarchy_).\\n\\nThe structure of a Speckle data (e.g. from a version) differs depending on the data sent and from which connector. While it is possible to write code that manually traverses a specific version, by **hardcoding assumptions** its structure, it is often desirable to **write code that can consume any Speckle data, sent from any connector**. For this, it is necessary to understand the common **rules for how the connectors structure data**, and how this data can be traversed.\\n\\nThis concept is most useful in connectors when receiving and converting data, but the concept of traversal applies for any use case with the need to preserve and transform the structure of data.\\n\\nSimply iterating through all Speckle objects and consuming them individually is insufficient. Many types of **objects contain several representations** and reference geometry objects that are part of their definition (rather than separate displayable objects).\\n\\nTo illustrate this, consider how the `Wall` object is defined:\\n\\n    public class Wall : Base\\n    {\\n        public double height { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public ICurve baseLine { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public string units { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Base> elements { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nThe `baseLine` curve forms part of the definition of the wall. And the `displayValue` provides a purely polygonal **mesh representation** of the mesh for display.\\n\\nA naïve function that consumes all objects one by one would **blindly consume** the baseline curve, and each mesh `displayValue` **without context** that it’s part of the Wall, nor do we have selectivity to choose which representation is use.\\n\\nFor these objects, it is necessary to be **selective about which properties should be traversed deeper**.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/selective-traversal.9b472fa6.png)\\n\\nWithin the Speckle connectors, **A `Wall` object is considered a convertible object**; the `baseLine` and `displayValue` representations **should be ignored** from being traversed.\\n\\nThis is where traversal functions come into play. These functions **encode the “rules” for which properties should be traversed**. And provides a convenient way to traverse Speckle data without making connector-specific assumptions about its structure.\\n\\nThe **Default Traversal Function** provides a de jure method of traversing Speckle objects, designed around a Speckle converter. This function is used by most of our connectors (with slight deviation) when receiving Speckle objects.\\n\\nIn general, a connector considers an object to be either:\\n\\n*   Convertible directly through a `ToNative` function\\n*   Convertible using displayValue (through a fall-back display value)\\n*   Convertible indirectly (through another conversion, as is the case for, say, `RenderMaterial`)\\n*   Not convertible at all\\n\\nDifferent connectors will have **different definitions of a “convertible” object**. There is no definitive list of “convertible” Speckle types. Connector-specific flexibility allows for **targeted interop** workflows and allows for the **intricacies of each host application**.\\n\\nAs part of the default traversal rules, we selectively traverse the properties of “convertible” objects. Only traversing `\"elements\"` (and its alias `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nAll other non-”convertible” objects will be traversed blindly (i.e. they have all properties traversed).\\n\\nCollections are a special case, As we handle them slightly differently depending on the connector. Some connectors (on receive) ignore all collection structures and convert objects the best way the native application allows. Others will use them to construct Layers, Tags, Collections, Groups etc.\\n\\nBe careful when dynamically attaching data to `Collection` objects to avoid inconsistent behaviour. We would advise keeping `\"elements\"` as the only traversed property. This is something we may consider enforcing in a future version of Core. This doesn’t mean you can’t use dynamic properties on collections, but it does avoid dynamically attaching geometry.\\n\\n[#](#using-the-traversal-functions)\\n Using the Traversal Functions\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor most use cases, the `DefaultTraversal` function can be used out of the box to consume Speckle objects individually while still retaining the object hierarchy (tree).\\n\\nThe below case demonstrates the `DefaultTraversal` implementation and how it can be used to iterate through the Tree. The `TraversalContext` objects are the tree nodes that contain the `current: Base` object and the `parent : TraveralContext`. Additionally, they contain the name of the parent’s property that was traversed to get to current.\\n\\n    async Task Foo(string myStream, ISpeckleConverter myConverter)\\n    {\\n        // Initialize traversal function with the given converter\\n        var traversalFunc = DefaultTraversal.CreateTraverseFunc(myConverter);\\n    \\n        // Receive commit object from the stream\\n        Base commitObject = await Helpers.Receive(myStream);\\n    \\n        // Traverse the commit object\\n        foreach (TraversalContext context in traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject))\\n        {\\n            // Get the current object in traversal\\n            Base current = context.current;\\n    \\n            // Get the parent of the current object\\n            TraversalContext? parent = context.parent;\\n    \\n            // Perform some operation on the current object\\n            // Replace `DoWork` with your actual functionality\\n            DoWork(current);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n\\nThe above code can be adapted to perform common tasks, such as\\n\\n*   Filter for walls\\n\\n    List<Wall> walls = traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .OfType<Wall>()\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n*   Filter for all objects by volume\\n\\n    List<Base> smallThings = traversalFunc\\n          .Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .Where(b => b[\"Volume\"] is double and < 20)\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n[#](#the-traversal-rule-builder)\\n The Traversal Rule Builder\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we delve into customizing traversal rules, let\\'s establish the default rules that are applied during traversal:\\n\\n**Default Traversal Rules:**\\n\\n1.  For Convertible Objects: Only the \"elements\" and its alias \"@elements\" properties are traversed.\\n2.  For Non-Convertible Objects: All properties are traversed, with no exceptions.\\n3.  For Collections: The \"elements\" property is the only one traversed, to avoid inconsistent behavior.\\n\\nNow that we understand the default behavior, let\\'s explore how you can create custom rules using the Traversal Rule Builder. The `TraversalRule` builder provides a means to construct a set of rules for how Speckle objects should be traversed. Each rule defines which properties of a Speckle object should be traversed and predicate criteria for when the rule is active for a given Speckle object.\\n\\n`GraphTraversal.Traverse(Base)` will perform a depth-first traversal of the provided commit object, adding objects into an internal stack. Rules are executed in order for the current `Base` object. The first rule, whose predicated function holds true, determines which members of said `Base` object are traversed (added to the stack).\\n\\nThe `DefaultTraversal` contains two simple rules. A rule is triggered for convertible objects (objects either convertible directly through the converter or through the existence of a `displayValue` property). For these objects, we only traverse `\"elements\"` (and `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nThe second rule, the default rule, is used for all other objects (i.e. non-convertible objects); it traverses all properties on an object (with the exception of `Obsolete` and `SchemaIgnore` members)\\n\\n    // Implementation of the default traversal function, simplified for brevity\\n    public static GraphTraversal CreateTraverseFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n    {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(converter.CanConvertToNative) //NOTE: only one `When` clause needs to evaluate true, for this rule to hold true \\n            .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(_ => true) //Always evaluates true\\n            .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers); //AllMembers returns all non-obsolete members (instance & dynamic)\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, defaultRule);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nInside the `DefaultTraversal` class, you will find another traversal function returned by `CreateRevitTraversalFunc`. This function is almost the same as the regular function. However, instead of performing a deep traversal of nested elements. Instead, it halts traversal as soon as it finds a convertible object. Deeper traversal is then performed by the Revit converter, which has more control over the hosting of nested Revit Elements.\\n\\n      public static GraphTraversal CreateRevitTraversalFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n      {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(converter.CanConvertToNative)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(None);\\n    \\n        var displayValueRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(_ => true)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers);\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, displayValueRule, defaultRule);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-don-t-use-a-converter)\\n What if I Don’t Use a Converter?\\n\\nThese functions were designed for Speckle connectors, which by design, do not reference the `Objects` assembly. Because of this, the functions are unaware of the specific object models designed to be convertible. Thus we use the `ISpeckleConverter` interface to avoid coupling of converter and connector code projects.\\n\\nHowever, other use cases may require consuming Speckle data outside of a connector/converter’s software architecture. Fear not! the traversal functions are flexible in achieving desirable behaviour. Adapting the `CreateTraverseFunction` function or engineering custom rules to achieve the desired result is possible.\\n\\nAs a quick workaround, you could substitute the `converter.CanConvertToNative` function with a simple `b => b.speckle_type.contains(\"Objects.Geometry\")`. This should handle raw geometry, and the `HasDisplayValue` predicate should handle all other types of convertible geometry. This should give you similar results to our converter’s, though there may be some edge cases where this behaves differently.\\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-custom-traversal-behaviour)\\n What if I Want Custom Traversal Behaviour?\\n\\nThe `TraverseRule` builder can be used to create **custom rules** and custom traversal behaviour. A rule is formed by specifying a number of predicate functions and a selection function to select which property name should be traversed when the rule evaluates true.\\n\\n    bool predicateFunction(Base b) {... }\\n    IEnumerable<string> memberSelectionFunction(Base b) {... }\\n        \\n    var myCustomRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(predicateFunction)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(memberSelectionFunction);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-to-capture-custom-context)\\n What if I Want to Capture Custom Context?\\n\\nThe `TraversalContext` and `GraphTraversal` classes are designed to be subclassable. This allows developers to capture additional context such as inherited data e.g. transformation matrices, display styles, render materials, etc.\\n\\n### [#](#what-about-specklepy)\\n What About SpecklePy?\\n\\nThe same Traversal rules are coming to SpecklePy very soon. They are already being used in the Blender connector. The `GraphTraversal` and `ITraversalRule` interface works exactly the same as in Sharp. However, instead of the builder pattern, the constructor args accept `Callable` functions (e.g., regular or lambda expressions).\\n\\n    def get_default_traversal_func(can_convert_to_native: Callable[[Base], bool]) -> GraphTraversal:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Initialize traversal function for traversing a speckle commit object.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        # Rule for convertible objects\\n        convertible_rule = TraversalRule(\\n          [can_convert_to_native],\\n          lambda _: {\"elements\", \"@elements\"},\\n        )\\n    \\n        default_rule = TraversalRule(\\n          [lambda _: True],\\n          lambda o: o.get_member_names(),\\n        )\\n    \\n        return GraphTraversal([convertible_rule, default_rule])\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-about-javascript-typescrip)\\n What About Javascript/Typescrip?\\n\\nAs of now, there\\'s **no immediate plan** to bring this traversal feature to JS/TS.

It includes geometry and element base classes as well as conversions routines for the AEC applications that we officially support. Objects uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS. You can find the code in [speckle-sharp/Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nObjects is available on NuGet as `Speckle.Objects`. All converters are also available under `Speckle.Objects.COnverter.*`.\\n\\nWhile the Objects is the default kit, you are free to develop your own kit or fork this one to customise it yourself. As of the beta release, easy swapping of kits within the connectors is not fully supported. However, this will be fully supported by the time we officially ship 2.0 🎉\\n\\nMore info on Objects and kits in 2.0 can be found in our [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#developing)\\n Developing\\n----------------------------\\n\\nObjects kit is just a set of simple data transfer objects that are fairly straightforward to understand. The object model is split into two main parts:\\n\\n*   `Geometry`: the basic building blocks such as points, lines, meshes, surfaces, etc\\n*   `BuiltElements`: higher level elements such as rooms, beams, ducts, openings, topography, etc\\n\\n### [#](#writing-objects)\\n Writing Objects\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute more [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects)\\n to the Objects kit or extend and customise the kit yourself, you can easily do so by creating new classes that inherit from `Base`. You can read more about the `Base` class [here](/dev/base)\\n. There are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nThe class itself needs to have an empty constructor for serialisation / deserialisation purposes. You can create as many additional constructors for your own use as makes sense.\\n\\nFor example, here is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n### [#](#specific-host-application-support)\\n Specific Host Application Support\\n\\nThe basic objects are intended to be as general as possible\\n\\nIn order to better support interop between the various AEC host applications and Speckle, Objects also contains classes that help to deal with native object types and their properties. These inherit from a more generic Speckle object but add additional properties that are important for specific applications, but are too specific to include in the generic object.\\n\\nFor example, [`Objects.BuiltElements.Revit` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements/Revit)\\n contains a collection of classes that extend the basic ones with a series of default Revit properties. This is the approach we\\'ll follow with other host applications as well.\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-schema-information-attributes-to-classes)\\n Adding Schema Information Attributes to Classes\\n\\nIn order for these _Host Application specific_ classes to be discoverable in any other host application (such as Grasshopper\\'s `Create Schema Object` node), this objects must contain at least one constructor with the attribute `SchemaInfo`. The attribute allows to provide human-readable names and descriptions that will be used to display to the user.\\n\\nIn addition, you can optionally add the `SchemaMainParam` attribute to one of the constructor\\'s inputs to signal it as the **main geometry parameter** for that Schema.\\n\\nHere\\'s the code for the `Objects.BuiltElements.Beam` constructor, with the `baseLine` flagged as its main parameter:\\n\\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n#### [#](#handing-breaking-changes-in-the-schema-model)\\n Handing Breaking Changes in the Schema Model\\n\\nThese information from the `SchemaInfo` attribute is used, among other places, to automatically generate all the Schema Nodes you\\'ll find in the Grasshopper Connector.\\n\\nThis means that any breaking-change on that object will have unwanted side-effects on the end-user; such as previously existing Schemas dissapearing without warning.\\n\\nIn order to prevent this, the recommended way to update is to:\\n\\n1.  Add a `SchemaDeprecated` attribute to the existing constructor, and modify it\\'s implementation if necessary.\\n2.  Create a new constructor with the new parameters and add the `SchemaInfo` attribute to it too.\\n\\nFollowing our previous `Beam` example. If we added two new properties to our beam (`width` and `height`), the final changes would look like this:\\n\\n    public double width;\\n    public double height;\\n    \\n    [SchemaDeprecated, SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = 1.0;\\n        this.width = 1.0;\\n    }\\n    \\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine, double height, double width)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = height;\\n        this.width = width;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nThis will ensure that anyone using the previous Schema definition can still do, but also provide a way to notify them that they should upgrade to the new/upgraded one.\\n\\n> These `SchemaDeprecated` constructors will eventually be deleted from the object model, but not before giving all users enough warning.\\n\\n### [#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n\\nThe Objects kit doesn\\'t just stop at Objects - you need converters as well! These can be found in [Objects/Converters (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n. Each converter is a class within the `Objects.Converter` namespace and contains conversion routines to a Speckle object and to the native software equivalent. The two key methods within a converter are predictably:\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nBoth of these core methods check if the specific type passed into it is supported by the converter, then calls the conversion method for that type accordingly.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nEach supported type has its own conversion routines. You can expand the support of a converter by adding your own conversions. Depending on the converter structure, you can do this by either adding a new partial class (Revit) or adding to the respective `ConverterX.Geometry` or `ConverterX.BuiltElements` file (RhinoGh, Dynamo, AutoCAD). As a simple example, here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#instances-transforms-and-definitions)\\n Instances, Transforms, and Definitions\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle supports object instancing across many connectors, using an abstract `Objects` class that allows for conversions between block instances in Rhino and AutoCAD, family instances in Revit, collections and geometry instances in Blender, instances in Sketchup, and more.\\n\\nWhat is an instance?\\n\\nIn Speckle, an **instance** is a single **transformation** of a detached, typed **definition** object containing _transformable geometry_.\\n\\n### [#](#instances)\\n Instances\\n\\nCheck out the [Instance class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Instance.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instances live in the `Objects.Other` namespace and are comprised of two main parts:\\n\\n1.  A detached `definition` object, which contains transformable geometry including other instances.\\n2.  A `transform` matrix indicating the transformations to be applied to the geometry inside the definition.\\n\\nConcretions of the `Instance` class can contain instance-specific properties outside of the shared definition. When scoping your own concretion, keep in mind that any properties which will be shared across instances of the same definition should belong in the `definition` class, and any properties which are specific to a single instance should be on the `Instance` class.\\n\\n**What about receiving Instances in applications that do not support instancing?**\\n\\nOur abstract `Instance` class also contains virtual `GetTransformableGeometry()` and `GetTransformedGeometry()` methods which should be overridden in concretions. These methods determine how to retrieve the transformable geometry inside the `definition` and transforms their vertices with the instance transform for use in applications which do not natively support instancing.\\n\\n### [#](#transforms)\\n Transforms\\n\\nCheck out the [Transform class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Transform.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instance transformations are stored in a `System.Numerics.Matrix4x4` typed 4x4 matrix.

As mentioned in [this page](/dev/kits)\\n, kits are made of:\\n\\n*   an object model\\n*   a set of converters\\n\\nA good example is the Objects kit, in our [speckle-sharp repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\n[#](#object-model)\\n Object Model\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAn Object Model is just a collection _data structures_. These are the types that the kit is supporting, and for which conversion routines need to be written so that you can send and receive from Speckle.\\n\\n### [#](#creating-an-object-model)\\n Creating an Object Model\\n\\nThere are a few general rules to keep in mind when writing these classes.\\n\\n#### [#](#_1-always-inherit-from-the-base-class)\\n 1. Always Inherit from the `Base` Class\\n\\nThis ensures serialisation and deserialisation happen through Speckle, with the default sane serialisation handling that we know we can support. Most importantly, it will enable type name handling and cross-kit legibility. For more on the `Base` class, head to the [Base Object](/dev/base)\\n section.\\n\\n#### [#](#_2-reference-loops-will-be-ignored)\\n 2. Reference Loops will be Ignored\\n\\nYou can always recreate them post deserialisation using a function flagged with the `[OnDeserialized]` attribute like so:\\n\\n      [OnDeserialized]\\n      internal void onDeserialized(StreamingContext context)\\n      {\\n        Edges.ForEach(e => e.Brep = this);\\n        Loops.ForEach(l => l.Brep = this);\\n        Trims.ForEach(t => t.Brep = this);\\n        Faces.ForEach(f => f.Brep = this);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n#### [#](#_3-keep-data-structures-lean)\\n 3. Keep Data Structures Lean\\n\\nYou should prefer typed arrays over lists of non-primitive values. For example, instead of a `List<Point>` for keeping track of mesh vertices, use a `List<double>`\\n\\n#### [#](#_4-always-include-a-parameterless-constructor)\\n 4. Always Include a Parameterless Constructor\\n\\nThis is for Newtonsoft serialisation / deserialisation. At worst, flag one constructor with the `[JsonConstructor]` attribute. Keep in mind this does indirect magic that can potentially trip you up - eg key names must match argument prop names.\\n\\n### [#](#example)\\n Example\\n\\nWith these rules in mind, creating your own classes by inheriting from `Base` is relatively straight forward. Additionally, there are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nFor a simple example, this is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n[#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n----------------------------\\n\\nConverters are the key to interoperability. They include the conversion routines for objects to and from the object model types. You create a new converter for each different application you want to support by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleConverter` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleConverter.cs)\\n. All your converters should live together in the same kit alongside your types. You can see how we\\'ve implemented converters in our default Objects kit [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n.\\n\\nConverters exist in the `MyKit.Converter` namespace and can either be broken up into smaller partial classes for each supported type (see the Revit Converter) or for each category (eg `ConverterX.Geometry` and `ConverterX.BuiltElements` as in the rest of our converters).\\n\\nThe converters must implement two key methods (plus a few others not described here):\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nThe specific conversion routines for each supported type are defined separately and called from these key methods. If the type is not supported, an error should be added to the converter\\'s `ConversionErrors` and a null object should be returned.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nAnd here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kit-interface)\\n Kit Interface\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got your object model and your conversion routines, you can officially put together your kit by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleKit` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleKit.cs)\\n and register your `Types` and `Converters`.\\n\\n    public interface ISpeckleKit\\n    {\\n      IEnumerable<Type> Types { get; }\\n    \\n      IEnumerable<string> Converters { get; }\\n    \\n      string Description { get; }\\n      string Name { get; }\\n      string Author { get; }\\n      string WebsiteOrEmail { get; }\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Tries to load a converter for a specific app.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"app\">Must be one of the Kits.Applications variables.</param>\\n      /// <returns>The converter for the specific app, or null.</returns>\\n      public ISpeckleConverter LoadConverter(string app);\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kitmanager)\\n KitManager\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe KitManager is a handy tool for loading up different kits.

This allows you, as a developer, to even use Speckle \"without Speckle\".\\n\\nWe currently have a couple of transports scaffolded:\\n\\n*   in memory\\n*   sqlite\\n*   disk\\n*   remote (speckle server)\\n*   mongodb (experimental)\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports are available on NuGet as `Speckle.Transports.*`.\\n\\nWhy are transports really cool? Imagine you want to write your own server, from scratch. To use it in all our connectors, the only thing you need to do is write a transport that uses your server\\'s api!\\n\\nAnother use case would be if you want to simultaneously send your data to a MySQL database. We currently do not support this, but using a custom built transport, you can send your data to it, at the same time as sending it to a Speckle server.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nWhere are all the transports?\\n\\n*   Required ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Core/Transports)\\n     (in-memory, sqlite)\\n*   Extraneous ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Transports)\\n     (Server, Disk, MongoDB)\\n\\nHere\\'s how the `ITransport` interface looks like.

To use the client, you\\'ll need access to a Speckle server. To authenticate the client, you\\'ll either need local accounts (added using [Manager](/user/manager)\\n), or you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    \\n    # initialise the client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    # authenticate the client with a token\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # if you\\'re in an environment without accounts, you can construct an Account object yourself\\n    # or authenticate with just a token\\n    # client.authenticate_with_token(\"YOUR_TOKEN\")\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nNow that you have an authenticated client, you can start interacting with the API. Let\\'s create a new stream and get that stream back.\\n\\n    # create a new stream. this returns the stream id\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # use that stream id to get the stream from the server\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nNext, we\\'ll need some data to send. Let\\'s extend `Base` to create a simple block to make it more interesting. All your custom objects should inherit from `Base` to ensure that serialization will work as expected.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point\\n    \\n    class Block(Base):\\n        length: float\\n        width: float\\n        height: float\\n        origin: Point = None\\n    \\n        def __init__(self, length=1.0, width=1.0, height=1.0, origin=Point(), **kwargs) -> None:\\n            super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n            # mark the origin as a detachable attribute\\n            self.add_detachable_attrs({\"origin\"})\\n    \\n            self.length = length\\n            self.width = width\\n            self.height = height\\n            self.origin = origin\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNow let\\'s send a block to the server! To do this, you\\'ll first need to send the object to the stream and get back the object id or hash. You can then use this to create a commit on the stream that references this object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    # here\\'s the data you want to send\\n    block = Block(length=2, height=4)\\n    \\n    # next create a server transport - this is the vehicle through which you will send and receive\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n    # this serialises the block and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=block, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # you can now create a commit on your stream with this object\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        stream_id=new_stream_id, \\n        object_id=hash, \\n        message=\"this is a block I made in speckle-py\",\\n        )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nTada! You should now have a commit on your stream containing your block. You\\'ll be able to see the commit on the stream page on the web. Receiving an object back is pretty similar to receiving it. You\\'ll generally be using the client to get a commit, then getting the hash to receive from the `referencedObject` attribute on that commit.\\n\\n    # this receives the object back from the transport.\\n    # the received data will be deserialised back into a `Block` \\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#short-hand-the-stream-wrapper)\\n Short Hand: The Stream Wrapper\\n\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to simply send and receive objects using the `SpeckleClient` and a `ServerTransport`. Since v2.2.6, you can use a handy helper to get a client and a transport from a stream URL - the `StreamWrapper`!\\n\\nThe `StreamWrapper` can parse any URL pointing to a stream, branch, commit, object, or globals. If you have a local account for the stream you provided, you can get an authenticated client and transport using the helper methods:\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.wrapper import StreamWrapper\\n    \\n    # provide any stream, branch, commit, object, or globals url\\n    wrapper = StreamWrapper(\"https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/commits/604bea8cc6\")\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated SpeckleClient if you have a local account for the server\\n    client = wrapper.get_client()\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated ServerTransport if you have a local account for the server\\n    transport = wrapper.get_transport()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#overview-of-functionality)\\n Overview of Functionality\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#graphql-client)\\n GraphQL Client\\n\\nThe `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API. You\\'ll need to have access to a speckle server to use this. To authenticate, you\\'ll need a token. You can either get one from an account you\\'ve already added to your computer using the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n, or you can head to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account, get_local_accounts\\n    \\n    all_accounts = get_local_accounts() # get back a list\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    \\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nInteracting with streams is designed to be intuitive and evocative of SpecklePy 1.0\\n\\n    # get a list of your most recent streams\\n    stream_list = client.stream.list()\\n    \\n    # search your streams\\n    results = client.stream.search(\"mech\")\\n    \\n    # create a stream\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # get a stream\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nNew in 2.0: branches and commits!

You will need to provide a `transport` to indicate where the objects should be sent to/received from. When sending, you can provide multiple transports to send the same object to multiple places simultaneously. Currently, we have three types of \\'transport\\': `SQLiteTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, and `ServerTransport`. If you\\'d like to learn more about Transports in Speckle 2.0, have a look [here](/dev/transports)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.memory import MemoryTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    transport = MemoryTransport()\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # this serialises the object and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=base_obj, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # if the object had detached objects, you can see these as well\\n    saved_objects = transport.objects # a dict with the obj hash as the key\\n    \\n    # this receives an object from the given transport, deserialises it,\\n    # and recomposes it into a base object.\\n    # you can optionally provide a local_transport which will default to\\n    # the `SQLiteTransport` pointing at your local cache\\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nYou can also use the GraphQL API to send and receive objects. However, note that this method will not recompose a base and will only get the object you explicitly ask for using by its id.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer\\n    \\n    # create a test base object\\n    test_base = Base()\\n    test_base.testing = \"a test base obj\"\\n    \\n    # run it through the serialiser\\n    s = BaseObjectSerializer()\\n    hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)\\n    \\n    # send it to the server\\n    objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id=\"stream id\", objects=[obj])\\n    \\n    received_base = client.object.get(\"stream id\", hash)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\n### [#](#base-object-and-serialization)\\n Base Object and Serialization\\n\\n#### [#](#the-base-object)\\n The Base Object\\n\\nThe `Base` class is the one you\\'re familiar with from the rest of the Speckle universe. It generally behaves the same way as it does in the other SDKs. For more info about the `Base` object, have a look [here](/dev/base)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # creating a base we will nest within a parent base\\n    detached_base = Base()\\n    detached_base.name = \"a detached base\"\\n    \\n    # creating our parent base object\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # attributes can be added using dot or dict notation\\n    base_obj.name = \"my base\"\\n    base_obj[\"colour\"] = \"lilac\"\\n    \\n    # other base objects can be nested within.\\n    # prepending the attribute name with `@` will detach the nested base when sending\\n    base_obj[\"@nested\"] = detached_base\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\nThe `Base` class has a few handy instance methods for identifying your object\\'s typed and dynamic attributes:\\n\\n*   `get_typed_member_names()` gets all of the names of the defined (typed) attributes of the object\\n*   `get_dynamic_member_names()` gets all of the names of the dynamic attributes of the object\\n*   `get_member_names()` gets a list of all the attributes on the object, dynamic or not\\n\\nEach `Base` object has an `id` (a unique hash) as it does in the other SDKs. This field is only populated if the `Base` has been previously serialized. If you _really_ need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.\\n\\n#### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nThe `Base` class can be subclassed to create your own custom objects. These are automatically added to a class-level registry, simply a dictionary with the type name as the key. The type is automatically populated by the `speckle_type` attribute but can be overwritten when writing your class.\\n\\nNote that all typed attributes of a class **must be initialized with a non-mutable default value** or a value that you will only change by reassignment.

You probably won\\'t ever need to use it directly. However, if you want, you can use it to get the id (hash) and a serializable object representation of the decomposed `Base`.

We\\'ll be receiving geometry from a stream, updating the data, and using it to do some calculations and simple plots using Plotly and Dash.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\nWe will assume you have general knowledge of Python and Speckle. If anything trips you up, have a look back at the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n or the [Speckle Concepts](/user/concepts)\\n.\\n\\nIf you want to follow along with the code, the repo for this project can be found [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/izzylys/demo-specklepy)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#receive-objects-from-the-server)\\n Receive Objects from the Server\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'ve already been through the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n, you\\'ll already know how to receive objects from the server. As a refresher, you\\'ll need to create a `SpeckleClient` which serves as your entry point to the API. We then authenticate this client using a token from a local account. If you haven\\'t used the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n to add a local account, you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token to use here. We\\'ll then use this client to get the commit we\\'re interested in.\\n\\nIn this case, we\\'re going to be looking at this twisty building Alan generated in Grasshopper and send to Speckle using the [Grasshopper Connector](/user/grasshopper)\\n. It has 10 levels split into separate objects each containing fields for facades, columns, banisters, and floor slabs.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-gh-commit.4e610fcb.gif)\\n\\nThe snippet below shows how you would authenticate the client, get the commit we\\'re interested in, and use a server transport to receive the commit object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    \\n    # create and authenticate a client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # get the specified commit data\\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    # create an authenticated server transport from the client and receive the commit obj\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#update-existing-objects)\\n Update Existing Objects\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve received this building from Grasshopper, let\\'s make some modifications. The data has already been structured nicely into a list of `Base` objects each representing a level. Each level has attributes containing that level\\'s facade, columns, banister, and floor slab.\\n\\n    {\\n        \"id\":  \"idfcaf8b9e145241dsdfa915885d87cda2\",\\n        \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\n        \"data\": [\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                \"id\":  \"ide6acabd37e865ce87a5sdf444d733877\",\\\\\\n                \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\\\\\n                \"@facade\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@columns\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@banister\": { ... },\\\\\\n                \"@floorSlab\": { ... }\\\\\\n            },\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                ...\\\\\\n            }\\\\\\n        ]\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nLet\\'s say we want to do some estimated embodied carbon calculations. However, currently no material information has been added to the elements in the stream. We can add this ourselves and update the stream for the rest of the team.\\n\\n### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nTo do this, let\\'s create classes for each material and add these materials to a \"material\" attribute on each object within the stream. Obviously, this is a bit of an over the top example. It would be more efficient to just add a string attribute to each object that indicates the material, then look up the material properties from a database when running the calculations. However, I want to have some fun here and show you some of the cool things you can do with the `Base` class!\\n\\nLet\\'s start with defining our materials as `Base` subclasses. This ensures they\\'ll be serialised correctly and that they\\'ll be picked up by the `Base` type registry. We can then create a mapping for each element type name to the `speckle_type` of the corresponding material class. The `speckle_type` is prepopulated by the class and defaults to the class name.\\n\\n    # density (kg/m^3) and embodied carbon (kg CO^2/kg) estimates\\n    # from https://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/embodied-energy/\\n    class Concrete(Base):\\n        density: str = 2400\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.159\\n    \\n    \\n    class Glass(Base):\\n        density: str = 2500\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.85\\n    \\n    \\n    class Steel(Base):\\n        density: str = 7800\\n        embodied_carbon = 1.37\\n    \\n    \\n    MATERIALS_MAPPING = {\\n        \"@floorSlab\": \"Concrete\",\\n        \"@banister\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@facade\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@columns\": \"Steel\",\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nWe can now write a function that iterates through all the members of a level and adds a material if it exists in our mapping.\\n\\n    def add_materials_data(level: Base) -> Base:\\n        # first, get all the attribute names\\n        names = level.get_member_names()\\n        # then iterate through them to check if they exist in our mapping\\n        for name in names:\\n            if name not in MATERIALS_MAPPING.keys():\\n                break\\n            # if they do, use this class method to get the class and init it\\n            material = Base.get_registered_type(MATERIALS_MAPPING[name])()\\n            # now we can add a `@material` attribute dynamically to each object.\\n            # note that we\\'re making it detachable with the `@`\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                prop[\"@material\"] = material\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                for item in prop:\\n                    item[\"@material\"] = material\\n        return level\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNote that we\\'ve added a _detached_ dynamic attribute called `@material` to each element we are interested in. We\\'ve marked it as detachable (prepended with an `@`) so we don\\'t store hundreds of copies of the same materials classes in this stream. Each instance of each materials class in our case is the same, so we only need to store each once. However, we want to reference them within multiple elements. Using a detachable attribute is the solution! You get a reference for the correct material object in each element, but you only store unique objects (in our case, one instance of each material class) in the stream.\\n\\n### [#](#sending-to-the-stream)\\n Sending to the Stream\\n\\nWe can now use the `add_materials_data()` method we wrote to update all the levels in the stream and send these updated levels back. Let\\'s add on to what we\\'ve already written.\\n\\nTo send our updated building, we\\'ll need to create a parent `Base` and place our list of nested levels inside this parent. To keep things consistent, we\\'ll be adding them to a field called `data`.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nWe\\'ll then use `operations.send()` to send this object to the stream, then use `client.commit.create()` to commit our changes to the stream. If we want to send to a new branch, we can do so by first creating one using `client.branch.create(stream_id, name, description)`. The snippet below shows this full process.\\n\\n    # recap from earlier\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a branch if you\\'d like\\n    branch_name = \"🐍 demo\"\\n    branches = client.branch.list(STREAM_ID)\\n    has_res_branch = any(b.name == branch_name for b in branches)\\n    if not has_res_branch:\\n        client.branch.create(\\n            STREAM_ID, name=branch_name, description=\"new stuff from py\"\\n        )\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    # and send the data to the server and get back the hash of the object\\n    obj_id = operations.send(base, [transport])\\n    \\n    # now create a commit on that branch with your updated data!\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        STREAM_ID,\\n        obj_id,\\n        branch_name,\\n        message=\"add detached materials\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n\\nIf we go back to the web to look at the stream, you\\'ll see your newest commit. The geometry should look the same since this hasn\\'t been modified, but stepping into the data will show you the new material attribute. As you can see in the gif below, the id of the `Concrete` object is the same on different floor slabs since the attribute is detached and the objects are identical.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-materials-data.dee7f66f.gif)\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve sent your changes to the server, anyone you\\'re collaborating with will also be able to pull down your changes and use these updated elements with materials data!\\n\\n[#](#do-cool-stuff)\\n Do Cool Stuff\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve now seen how we can receive, work with, and send data from Python just like you can with any of the other SDKs and connectors. Great, now we can use that data to make something cool! Let\\'s plot the data using [plotly (opens new window)](https://plotly.com/python/)\\n and display it on a simple page using [dash (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n. I won\\'t go into too much detail on using the libraries themselves, but most of the plotting code has just been modified from the boilerplate and examples in their docs.\\n\\nTo start, let\\'s extract some existing data from the objects and plot them. Each geometry object we\\'re interested in has a `Vertices` attribute containing a list of points. Let\\'s plot the vertices of the floor slabs and columns on a 3D scatter plot. To do this, we\\'ll need to construct a pandas data frame with the values we are interested in by iterating through the levels.\\n\\n    import pandas as pd\\n    \\n    def construct_points_df(levels: List[Base]):\\n        # initialise a pandas data frame\\n        df_vertices = pd.DataFrame(columns=(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"element\"))\\n    \\n        vertices = []\\n        for level in levels:\\n            # add column vertices\\n            columns = level[\"@columns\"]\\n            for column in columns:\\n                points = column.Vertices\\n                for p in points:\\n                    vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"columns\"})\\n            # add floor slab vertices\\n            floorslab = level[\"@floorSlab\"]\\n            points = floorslab.Vertices\\n            for p in points:\\n                vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"floorSlab\"})\\n    \\n        return df_vertices.append(vertices)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nNow we can just pass that data frame into the plotly express `scatter_3d` method and `show()` the figure.\\n\\n    import plotly.express as px\\n    \\n    df_vertices = construct_points_df(levels)\\n    \\n    fig = px.scatter_3d(\\n        df_vertices,\\n        x=\"x\",\\n        y=\"y\",\\n        z=\"z\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        opacity=0.7,\\n        title=\"Element Vertices (m)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    fig.show()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\nPlotly plots have interactivity built in, so this is all the code we need to produce this 3D scatter plot.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VGcrHPB.gif)\\n\\nNext, let\\'s make use of the material properties we added to each of the stream objects. Let\\'s calculate the mass and embodied carbon for each element type in one level and construct a data frame with the results.\\n\\n    def construct_carbon_df(level: Base):\\n        data = {\"element\": [], \"volume\": [], \"mass\": [], \"embodied carbon\": []}\\n    \\n        # get the attributes on the level object\\n        names = level.get_dynamic_member_names()\\n        # iterate through and find the elements with a `volume` attribute\\n        for name in names:\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                if not hasattr(prop, \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                # if it has a volume, use the material attribute to calculated\\n                # the embodied carbon\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(prop.volume)\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                if not hasattr(prop[0], \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(sum(p.volume for p in prop))\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            data[\"element\"].append(name[1:]) # removing the prepending `@`\\n    \\n        return pd.DataFrame(data)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nUsing this data frame, we can use the plotly express `pie()` and `bar()` methods to create some lovely plots.\\n\\n    # take the first level from our levels list and construct a data frame\\n    df_carbon = construct_carbon_df(levels[0])\\n    \\n    # let\\'s add them all to a dict to keep the together\\n    figures = {}\\n    \\n    figures[\"volumes\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"volume\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Volumes of Elements Per Floor (m3)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon bar\"] = px.bar(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        x=\"element\",\\n        y=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon pie\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nThe last thing we\\'re going to do is add the figures to a dash app. To do this, we are simply taking the boilerplate [dash layout (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n, replacing the sample figure with our own figures, and adding some custom css in `/assets/style.css`.\\n\\n// Make sure to add code blocks to your code group\\n\\nNow all that\\'s left is to run `app.py` and head to [`http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (opens new window)](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)\\n to see your amazing plots.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\n[#](#conclusion)\\n Conclusion\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAnd voila - you\\'ve created the basis for a dashboard powered by your Speckle data!

The examples assume a Viewer instance named `v`.\\n\\n### [#](#load-unload-an-object)\\n Load/Unload an Object\\n\\n`v.loadObject( objectUrl )` / `v.unloadObject( objectUrl )`\\n\\nExample: `v.loadObject( 'https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/objects/e05c5834368931c9d9a4e2087b4da670' )`\\n\\n### [#](#get-properties-of-loaded-objects)\\n Get Properties of Loaded Objects\\n\\n`v.getObjectsProperties()`\\n\\nThis returns a dictionary with `{ propertyName: propertyInfo }` elements. The property information provided is:\\n\\n*   `type` ( == `'string'` / `'number'` / `'boolean'`): the property type\\n*   `objectCount` (int): How many objects in the scene have this property\\n*   `allValues` (array of `objectCount` elements): The values for this property of all objects that have this property\\n*   `minValue` - the smallest value (using `<` operator, works also on strings)\\n*   `maxValue` - the largest value\\n*   `uniqueValues` - a dictionary of `{ uniqueValue: occurrenceCount }` elements, specifying how many objects have the property set to that specific value\\n\\n### [#](#filtering-and-colouring)\\n Filtering and Colouring\\n\\nThose calls filter and color the objects loaded in the scene, and drops the previous applied filters (filtering is not additive).\\n\\nSyntax: `await v.applyFilter( { filterBy, colorBy, ghostOthers } )`\\n\\nThe 3 optional parameters are:\\n\\n*   `filterBy`: A dictionary that specify the filter. Elements are in the form `{ propertyName: propertyValueFilter }`. The propertyValueFilter can be one of:\\n    \\n    *   A specific value: (only objects with that property value pass the filter)\\n    *   An array of values: An object passes the filter if its value is in the array\\n    *   A range of values, specified by `{ 'gte': value1, 'lte': value2 }` (greater than or equal, lower than or equal)\\n    *   An exclusion list, specified by `{ 'not': excludedValuesArray }`\\n*   `colorBy`: A dictionary that makes all objects colored based on a property value. Two types of coloring are supported:\\n    \\n    *   Gradient (from a numeric property): `{ 'type': 'gradient', 'property': propertyName, 'minValue': propertyMinValue, 'maxValue': propertyMaxValue, 'gradientColors': [color1, color2] }`\\n    *   Category (for coloring each unique value differently): `{ 'type': 'category', 'property': propertyName, 'values': { value1: color1, value2: color2, ... }, 'default': colorForAnyOtherValue }`. The `values` and the `default` parameters are optional: Random colors are generated if they are omitted.\\n*   `ghostOthers`: A boolean (default `false`).

With just a few lines of code, you\\'ll be able to send, receive and leverage our API from Google Sheets, Docs etc.\\n\\nHere\\'s a few examples to get you started.\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nFirst of all we need to create a [Personal Access Token](/dev/tokens)\\n, make sure to select the scopes that you\\'ll need for running your queries and mutations. As always, treat this token as a password!\\n\\n[#](#writing-your-queries)\\n Writing your Queries\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo learn how to write queries check out our section on the [Server API](/dev/server-api)\\n, and use the GraphQL explorer to make sure your query or mutation works as expected.\\n\\nNext, since App Scripts doesn\\'t have a GraphQL library we need to transform them a bit to work with `UrlFetchApp`, it\\'s just a matter of setting the right payload and parameters.\\n\\nHere\\'s what a function that runs a query to get the currently logged user looks like, remember to replace `YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN`. You can extend its fields to get the streams, branches and commits as well:\\n\\n    function getMe() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `query User {\\n                          user{\\n                            id,\\n                            email,\\n                            name\\n                          }\\n                        }`,\\n        variables: null,\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n\\nTIP\\n\\nHow do you create a token, we hear you ask? Read the section on [personal access tokens](/dev/tokens.html)\\n!\\n\\nHere\\'s a function that runs a mutation to create a new stream:\\n\\n    function createStream() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `mutation streamCreate($myStream: StreamCreateInput!) { streamCreate(stream: $myStream) }`,\\n        variables: {\\n          myStream: {\\n            name: \"Sample Stream\",\\n            description: \"Created from Google Sheets!\",\\n          },\\n        },\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nThis is all!

You can then use this to trigger ci apps, automation workflows, and more! The world is your oyster. Let\\'s have a quick look at how to work with them.\\n\\n[#](#setting-up-a-stream-webhook)\\n Setting Up A Stream Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOn the sidebar of a stream, you\\'ll find a \"⚙ Settings\" button. Click this and head to the \"Webhooks\" tab to add webhooks to your stream.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126977638-67d2958c-12d2-40b2-aef3-da5a01451773.gif)\\n\\nThere are a few different fields to fill out when setting up a webhook:\\n\\n*   URL: The URL that will be sent `POST` requests when your webhook is triggered\\n*   Description: Optional identifying text (will be shown when viewing all your webhooks in a list)\\n*   Secret: An optional token that will help you verity that requests you receive are actually coming from the Speckle Server. Requests will be secured with an `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` which you can verify upon receiving.\\n*   Triggers: The events you want to trigger the webhook\\n*   Enabled: Toggle the webhook on and off\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126979041-ac01d1f7-e9d3-455c-ab4f-7154ab891a96.png)\\n\\nYou can of course also manage webhooks via the [GraphQL API](/dev/server-graphql-api)\\n using the `webhookCreate`, `webhookUpdate`, and `webhookDelete` mutations. There is a `webhooks` field on the `stream` schema which you can query to get the webhooks for a stream and the `history` of previous requests.\\n\\n[#](#receiving-the-webhook)\\n Receiving the Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen the condition defined in the webhook definition is met, a `POST` request will be made to the provided URL.\\n\\nThe POST request will contain 1 string parameter, called `payload`, that is the JSON representation of the webhook payload.\\n\\nImportant note on the JSON encoding\\n\\nThe way of passing the POST parameter is `application/json`, and the parameter is again encoded as JSON for compatibility with various frameworks that don\\'t handle nested json properties. So the actual POST request body might look something like:\\n\\n    {\"payload\":\"{\\\\\"streamId\\\\\":\\\\\"a35c7a8bdd\\\\\",\\\\\"userId\\\\\":\\\\\"bc4e472126\\\\\",\\\\\"activityMessage\\\\\":\\\\\"Stream metadata changed\\\\\", ...\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nTo ensure that only the configured Speckle Server will successfully call your publicly available webhook server, there is the `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` header that can be used to validate the authenticity of the call. It is the sha256 HMAC on the payload json string, using the shared secret configured on the webhook. Example python code to validate the signature:\\n\\n    import hmac\\n    # ...\\n    \\n    expected_signature = hmac.new(SHARED_SECRET.encode(), payload_json.encode(), \\'sha256\\').hexdigest()\\n    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, SIGNATURE_FROM_HEADER):\\n        print(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n        return\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nAnd javascript (node):\\n\\n    const * as crypto from \\'crypto\\'\\n    \\n    const secret = \\'YOUR_SECRET_HERE\\'\\n    const expectedSignature = crypto\\n        .createHmac(\\'sha256\\', secret)\\n        .update(request.body.payload)\\n        .digest(\\'hex\\')\\n    const signatureFromHeader = request.headers[\\'x-webhook-signature\\']\\n    \\n    if (signatureFromHeader != expectedSignature) response.status(401).send(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#reporting-success)\\n Reporting Success\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe endpoint code should return a HTTP response status header. The server recognises statuses `200 OK` to `204 NO_CONTENT` as a successful execution. Alternatively, your endpoint can respond with other statuses in its execution. The webhook execution log shows these as error with additional payload data you supply to diagnose issues.\\n\\nGo back to the main \"Webhooks\" tab to view all the webhooks on the stream. Click on a webhook to open the edit menu. The symbol to the left to the description indicates the status of the last webhook request; hover over it to get more information. Here, the green ✔ indicates the last request was successfully sent. The grey circle with an ❕ indicates no requests have been sent yet (you\\'ve likely just created the webhook and none of the triggers have happened yet).

This has security implications too.\\n*   database backups: again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability. Cloud providers can provide horizontal VM auto-scaling and Kubernetes can provide horizontal pod auto-scaling but these are not discussed in this guide.\\n*   monitoring: this setup does not describe integrations for telemetry, metrics, tracing, or logging. Nor does it describe alerting or response actions.\\n*   firewall and network hardening: running in production requires additional security hardening measures, particularly protecting the network from intrusion or data exfiltration.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n*   \\\\[Required\\\\] A [DigitalOcean (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\\n     account.

We provided the cluster a name, but otherwise left configuration as per DigitalOcean\\'s recommended defaults. When prompted to select the node count and size, we selected four nodes. Each node has the default 2 vcpu and 4Gb (`s-2vcpu-4gb`). While this is a minimum, your usage may vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by deploying new nodes or larger sized machines in new node-pools. ![](/assets/img/01_select_node_size.07d7fdb8.png)\\n    \\n*   Configure other options for your Kubernetes cluster and click the `Create Cluster` button. After the cluster is created and initialized, you should see it in your list of kubernetes clusters: ![](/assets/img/02_kubernetes_clusters.21c632ca.png)\\n    \\n*   To log into the cluster, follow the getting started guide on the DigitalOcean dashboard for your cluster. We recommend the automated option of updating your local Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) using the [DigitalOcean client, `doctl` (opens new window)](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)\\n    . ![](/assets/img/03_get_kubeconfig.44d3076f.png)\\n    \\n*   After downloading the kubernetes config, you can verify that your kubernetes client has the cluster configuration by running the following command. A list of kubernetes clusters will be printed, your cluster context should have the prefix `do-`. Make a note of the name, you will use this in place of `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` in most of the following steps of this guide.\\n    \\n\\n    kubectl config get-contexts\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/04_show_contexts.5ec3c519.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl by running the following command to show the nodes you have provisioned.

Go to the [new Database creation page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new)\\n    . Firstly, select the same region and VPC as you used when deploying your Kubernetes cluster, and select Redis. Provide a name, and click `Create Database Cluster`. Again we used the default sizes, but your usage will vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by the database size as necessary. ![](/assets/img/06_redis_configuration.a2b13eaf.png)\\n    \\n*   From the overview, click on `Secure this database cluster by restricting access.`. This will take you to the Trusted Sources panel in the Settings tab. Here we will improve the security of your database by only allowing connections from your Kubernetes cluster. Type the name of your Kubernetes cluster and add it as a Trusted Source. ![](/assets/img/07_redis_trusted_source.8508d0c6.png)\\n    \\n*   In the Overview tab for your Redis database. Select `connection string` from the dropdown, and copy the displayed Connection String.

Go to the [new Database creation page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new)\\n    . Firstly, select the same region and VPC as you used when deploying your Kubernetes cluster, and then select Postgres. Provide a name, and click `Create Database Cluster`.

You can provide your own if you have an existing blob storage which is compatible with the [Amazon S3 API (opens new window)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)\\n. Otherwise follow the following steps to create a new S3-compatible blob storage on DigitalOcean.\\n\\n*   Navigate to the [Create a Space page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/new)\\n    . Please select a region of your choice, we recommend the same region as you have deployed the cluster. We did not enable the CDN and we restricted the file listing for security purposes. Please provide a name for your Space, this has to be unique in the region so please use a different name than our example. Make a note of this name, this is the `bucket` value which we will require when configuring your deployment in [step 4](#step-4-configure-your-deployment)\\n    . Click on `Create Space`. ![](/assets/img/12_blob_storage_configuration.b77b8f17.png)\\n    \\n*   Once created, click on the `Settings` tab and copy the `Endpoint` value. ![](/assets/img/13_spaces_endpoint.1ed95325.png)\\n    \\n*   Now navigate to the [API page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)\\n     in DigitalOcean. Next to the `Spaces access keys` heading, click `Generate New Key`.

We can create a namespace in our Kubernetes cluster with the following command. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n\\n    kubectl create namespace speckle --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/15_create_namespace.a9e6faa4.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that the namespace was created by running the following command. You should see a list of namespaces, including `speckle`. The other existing namespaces were created by Kubernetes and are required for Kubernetes to run. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.\\n\\n    kubectl get namespace --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/16_get_namespaces.39b228b4.png)\\n\\n### [#](#step-3-b-create-secrets)\\n Step 3.b: Create Secrets\\n\\n*   To securely store the connection details of Speckle\\'s dependencies, we will create a secret in the Kubernetes Cluster in the `speckle` namespace. Replace all the items starting with `${YOUR_...}` with the appropriate value. `${YOUR_SECRET}` should be replaced with a value unique to this cluster, we recommend creating a random value of at least 10 characters long.\\n\\n    kubectl create secret generic server-vars \\\\\\n     --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\" \\\\\\n     --namespace speckle \\\\\\n     --from-literal=redis_url=\"${YOUR_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=postgres_url=\"${YOUR_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=s3_secret_key=\"${YOUR_SPACES_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=session_secret=\"${YOUR_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=email_password=\"${YOUR_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD}\" # optional, only required if you wish to enable email invitations\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n*   You can verify that your secret was created correctly by running the following command.

This will allow web browser\\'s to resolve your domain name to the IP of the load balancer. The domain must match the domain name provided to Speckle in the `values.yaml` file you edited previously. If DigitalOcean manages your Domain Names, adding a DNS A record using \\\\[DigitalOcean\\'s Domain page(https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains) will look something like the following: ![](/assets/img/32_domain_a_record.74fb0b6b.png)\\\\\\n    \\\\\\n*   It may take a moment for the domain name and A Record to be propagated to all relevant DNS servers, and then for Let\\'s Encrypt to be able to reach your domain and generate a certificate.

This guide provides details on how to do that.\\n*   If you want to deploy the Server with your own modifications, you should build your own docker images. Please refer to our separate guide on [local development](./server-local-dev)\\n    .\\n\\n[#](#dependencies)\\n Dependencies\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe Speckle server needs these services available over the network:\\n\\n*   PostgreSQL (tested with v12 and v13)\\n*   Redis\\n*   Optional: S3-compatible Object Storage\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nPostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO are included in the following deployment instructions, so **you don\\'t need to install them manually**.\\n\\nYou can also install them manually or use a managed deployment from a cloud provider (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc). Setting them up manually is out of scope of this article.\\n\\n[#](#run-in-a-virtual-machine)\\n Run in a Virtual Machine\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThis setup is not recommended for use in production for a few reasons, namely:\\n\\n*   application level updates: we tend to move quite fast, and if things get busy, blink twice and you’re on an outdated server. this has security implications too.\\n*   guaranteed uptime: from our experience, vm’s tend to restart now and then (they need updates and reboots too), which results in downtime.\\n*   database backups - again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   end-to-end encryption: possibly less of daily concern - we’re offering from encryption at rest, to https security (SSL/TLS certs & renewal) - so whenever data travels between a client and the db it’s always encrypted, inc. inside the datacenter itself.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\nThis is the easiest way to get the Server running.\\n\\nAs prerequisites, you only need a Linux VM with at least 4 GB of RAM and have [Docker (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)\\n and [Docker Compose (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)\\n installed.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-create-a-directory-for-this-deployment-on-the-system)\\n Step 1: Create a Directory for this Deployment on the System\\n\\n    mkdir /opt/speckle/\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#step-2-copy-and-paste-this-into-a-file-named-docker-compose-yml-in-your-directory)\\n Step 2: Copy and paste this into a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your directory\\n\\n    version: \"2.3\"\\n    name: \"speckle-server\"\\n    \\n    services:\\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server dependencies\\n      #######\\n      postgres:\\n        image: \"postgres:14.5-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          POSTGRES_DB: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_USER: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: speckle\\n        volumes:\\n          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/\\n        healthcheck:\\n          # the -U user has to match the POSTGRES_USER value\\n          test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready -U speckle\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      redis:\\n        image: \"redis:7-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - redis-data:/data\\n        ports:\\n          - \"127.0.0.1:6379:6379\"\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"--raw\", \"incr\", \"ping\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      minio:\\n        image: \"minio/minio\"\\n        command: server /data --console-address \":9001\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - minio-data:/data\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"mc\", \"ready\", \"local\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 5\\n    \\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server\\n      #######\\n      speckle-ingress:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-docker-compose-ingress:2\\n        restart: always\\n        ports:\\n          - \"0.0.0.0:80:8080\"\\n        environment:\\n          FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_MB: \"100\"\\n          NGINX_ENVSUBST_OUTPUT_DIR: \"/etc/nginx\"\\n    \\n      speckle-frontend-2:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-frontend-2:2\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME: \"local\"\\n          # TODO: Change NUXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN to the URL of the speckle server, as accessed from the network.

You can find instructions on how to do that [here](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n.\\n\\nTo update Speckle:\\n\\n1.  connect to the virtual machine running the Speckle server instance\\n2.  navigate to the folder, where the Speckle server docker-compose file is located\\n3.  run `docker compose down` (this will take the server offline)\\n4.  review the latest changes in this guide against your `docker-compose.yml` file, and amend as necessary.\\n5.  run `docker compose pull` (this will retrieve the latest images)\\n6.  run `docker compose up -d` (this starts the server stack, and runs it in the background)\\n\\nYour server instance should be back online and updated.\\n\\n[#](#run-your-speckle-server-fork)\\n Run Your Speckle-Server Fork\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you made some changes to the server and want to run those instead of the official releases, we created some useful docker-compose.yml files to help with that.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-set-up-dependencies)\\n Step 1: Set up Dependencies\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you set up PostgreSQL, Redis and S3-compatible service outside of this VM (for example a managed deployment from a cloud provider), you can skip this step, but remember to set up the correct environment variables later\\n\\nTo get the PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO dependencies up and running in the VM, our git repo contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-deps.yml)\\n for running these dependencies locally in docker containers.\\n\\nIt also includes `PGAdmin` and `redis-insight` to be able to explore the raw data. If you don\\'t need them, you can safely remove those entries from the `docker-compose-deps.yml` file.\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _PostgreSQL v13_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:5432` with default credentials `speckle`:`speckle` and a database named `speckle`.\\n*   _Redis v6_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:6379`\\n*   _PGAdmin4_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:16543` with default credentials `admin@localhost` : `admin`\\n*   _Redis Insight_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:8001`\\n*   _MinIO_, listening on `127.0.0.1:9000` with the API endpoint and on `127.0.0.1:9001` with the Web Management Interface (default credentials used: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)\\n\\nAll of the above containers listen on the local loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`) and are NOT accessible from the local network (for security, since they use default credentials)\\n\\nTo use PGAdmin, after login you can configure a server connection to the host `postgres` (user `speckle`, password `speckle`, database `speckle`)\\n\\nTo use Redis Insight, you can configure it to connect to the hostname `redis` (port `6379`)\\n\\nDocker Compose creates named docker volumes for storing data for each of the containers, so data is persisted. You can view existing docker volumes with `docker volume ls` and delete a volume and existing data with `docker volume rm [volume_name]`\\n\\n### [#](#step-2-build-and-run-your-code)\\n Step 2: Build and Run Your Code\\n\\nThe git repository contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-speckle.yml)\\n for building and running the Speckle server frontend and backend in docker containers.\\n\\nTo use it, first edit the variables in the `docker-compose-speckle.yml` file to reflect your environment. Then, you can start them with:\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-speckle.yml up --build -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\n(You can safely ignore the warnings about the _orphan containers_)\\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _docker-compose-ingress_, an nginx container that routes traffic to either speckle-frontend-2 or speckle-server as required. This is exposed on port 80 in the VM network.\\n*   _speckle-frontend-2_, the frontend Vue app. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _speckle-server_, the `server` component. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _preview-service_, the component that generates stream previews. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _webhook-service_, the component that calls webhooks. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _fileimport-service_, the component that imports uploaded files.

This is a high efficiency getting started step list.\\n\\n[#](#supported-platforms)\\n Supported Platforms\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle server has been developed on Linux, Windows WSL2, and MacOS. It _does not_ work on Windows without WSL2.\\n\\nOn MacOS devices with Apple based chips (M2, M3 etc.) it is possible to run the server as described below, but building and running Dockerfiles takes a lot of time (due to emulation of an x86 platform).\\n\\n### [#](#steps)\\n Steps\\n\\n1.  `git clone git@github.com:specklesystems/speckle-server.git` or, alternatively `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git`\\n2.  `cd speckle-server`\\n3.  `corepack enable`\\n4.  `yarn`\\n5.  `yarn build`\\n6.  `yarn dev:docker:up`\\n7.  `cp packages/server/.env-example packages/server/.env`\\n8.  `cp packages/server/.env.test-example packages/server/.env.test`\\n9.  `cp packages/frontend-2/.env.example packages/frontend-2/.env`\\n10.  `cp packages/dui3/.env.example packages/dui3/.env`\\n11.  `yarn dev`\\n\\nWait for the frontend to build, and voila, you have a fully functional Speckle Server running at [http://localhost:3000 (opens new window)](http://localhost:3000)\\n.\\n\\nTo run a specific part of the Speckle server stack, go to the [components](#components)\\n section\\n\\n[#](#details)\\n Details\\n----------------------\\n\\nLet's step back and see what we did.\\n\\n1.  To clone the repo git with [ssh key (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\\n     auth was used. You can use https based auth too, and can also gather some bonus points by using the `gh-cli` 😄\\n2.  We change into the cloned repository directory.\\n3.  Nodejs versions ^16 now come with a package manager manager bundled named `corepack`. It enables us to use yarn without actually installing anything.\\n4.  The monorepo is managed by [yarn workspaces (opens new window)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)\\n    . This way the package manager handles dependencies of the monorepo and the proper connections between the different packages. Running `yarn` a shorthand for `yarn install` bootstraps the repo.\\n5.  Some of the local packages (viewer, object loader) has to be built the first time so that all packages are linked properly. This can be done easily with a yarn script, where the yarn command will execute the given build script in all packages where it exists. So running `yarn build` triggers all available build commands.\\n6.  In this step, all the required services are started via docker compose. The `docker-compose-deps.yml` file contains a sensible default setup of all the required non Speckle developed services. This config by no means meant to be used in production. If you are not running these dependencies via docker compose, please make sure, that their configuration options are in line with either the compose file or the individual package configurations.\\n7.  In this step the provided example file is copied to a `.env` file with keeping the default values. Here again we are providing a set of sensible defaults that work out of the box if you follow this guide, but do make sure to reflect any changes you make in you environment.\\n8.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied when running tests or running the server in test mode\\n9.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to the new frontend\\n10.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to dui3\\n11.  Just like above, we use yarn to run the `dev` script in each package. This is probably not the most efficient way, since it starts more packages in development mode, than needed, but its the easiest command that gets a server up and running. When developing, you probably want to run each component separately. A good enough setup might be to just run the server and the preferred frontend (run `yarn dev` only in those individual package directories).\\n\\nWhen running `yarn dev` for all packages you might see errors relating to `@speckle/shared` being missing, but this is only temporarily because `@speckle/shared` is also being re-built at that point in time. Once its finished building all of the other packages should pick up on it and work fine. You might also see GraphQL Codegen errors, which also are temporary, because they rely on the speckle server being up and running.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon't forget to set up the variables in the `.env` & `.env.test` files according to your deployment\\n\\n[#](#components)\\n Components\\n----------------------------\\n\\nTo run a barebones Speckle Server, you need to run:\\n\\n*   the `frontend-2` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/frontend-2)\\n    )\\n*   the `server` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/server)\\n    )\\n\\nOptionally, to enable extra functionality, microservices should be run separately. For more information, check their `README.md` file in the git repository:\\n\\n*   the `preview-service` package generates preview images for streams (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/preview-service)\\n    )\\n*   the `webhook-service` package is responsible with calling the configured webhooks\\n*   the `fileimport-service` package parses and imports uploaded files into Speckle.\\n\\nDetailed instructions for running them locally are kept up to date in their respective `readme.md` files.\\n\\nIn this deployment type, the frontend Vue app will listen by default on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 8080`, but will have no knowledge about the `server` component, and thus **should not be accessed directly**.\\n\\nThe server component will listen on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 3000`, and will proxy the frontend requests to the frontend component (as configured in .env file).\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/server-local-dev.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/8/2024, 8:34:04 AM\\n\\n← [Deploying a Server - Docker Compose](/dev/server-manualsetup.html) [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)\", metadata={'title': 'Local Development Environment | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/server-local-dev'}),\n",

If installed with Speckle\\'s manual installation, by default the value of these are all `speckle`.\\n5.  (optional) For some databases, but not the default database provided by Speckle, you may also have to provide a Certificate.\\n    \\n    1.  Copy this certificate into the pgadmin container with `docker cp ./local/path/to/my/certificate.crt speckle-server-pgadmin-1:/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/` (assuming the default pgadmin user is `admin@localhost.com` and `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` is the name of the pgAdmin container.)\\n    2.

Expand `docker-compose` and `databases` to select your database. The default database name for Speckle is `speckle`.\\n    \\n2.  Once you have found the database in pgAdmin, right-click the database name and select `backup`.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/04_pgadmin_backup.47b980b4.png)\\n    \\n3.  Provide a filename in the `general` tab.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/05_pgadmin_backup_dialog.b772dd50.png)\\n    \\n4.  In the `options` tab, select the options `Include CREATE DATABASE statement` and `Include DROP DATABASE statement`.\\n    \\n5.  Then start the backup process. This will generate a backup that is stored in the container\\'s volume.\\n    \\n6.  Once the backup is prepared, we now need to save the file to your local machine.\\n    \\n    *   If a `Click to open file location` button is displayed (this may depend on the version of pgAdmin running), click on it and download the backup to your machine.\\n        \\n    *   If a button is not displayed, you can copy the file from the container to your machine by user docker. Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n        \\n            docker cp speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/BACKUP_FILE_NAME\\' .\\n            \\n        \\n        1  \\n        \\n    *   If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake further steps to move the file from the host machine to either your local machine or storage location of your choice. DigitalOcean [suggest using `scp` (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-copy-files-from-one-server-to-another-droplet)\\n        .\\n        \\n7.  We recommend testing the integrity of the backup at this time. One way of doing this is to install speckle-server on another machine (or modify the name and ports in the file and install a second locally), then upload the backup per the below instructions using pgAdmin. Use pgAdmin or Speckle to check that the information is present.\\n    \\n8.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\n### [#](#backing-up-a-docker-volume-optional)\\n Backing up a Docker Volume (Optional)\\n\\nAs well as creating a Postgres backup, we also recommend a full Docker volume backup. The Docker volume backup can only be used with the current version of Postgres, so is more limited than the Postgres backup created via pgAdmin (the latter allows us to move data between different versions of Postgres, which is useful when upgrading). Generating an additional backup from the Docker volume provides us with additional confidence that we can recover to a previous good working state.\\n\\n1.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  Follow the instructions on backing up a Docker Volume in [Docker\\'s Documentation (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)\\n    \\n3.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\nIf you are not upgrading the Postgres database, you can stop at this step. The following instructions relate only to the event of a major version upgrade of Postgres.\\n\\n### [#](#preparing-postgres-for-an-upgrade)\\n Preparing Postgres for an upgrade\\n\\n1.  Determine the name of the Docker container that is running your Postgres database, and the version of Postgres.\\n    \\n        docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  If successful, the above will print out something similar to the below. In our example the name is `speckle-server-postgres-1` and the image version `13-alpine`.\\n    \\n        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                      NAMES\\n        510e024a4700   postgres:13-alpine   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp   speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    2  \\n    \\n3.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step will cause Speckle, and any other application relying on the database, to stop working until the database is restored. You may wish to notify users of your Speckle server about the disruption to Speckle before proceeding with this and the following steps. Stop your Postgres database with the following command, replacing `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker stop speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Remove the container from docker, this detaches it from its volume and allows the volume to be deleted. Replace `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker rm speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  During upgrades we recommend undertaking a Docker volume backup. This allows us to restore to the previous version if the upgrade was unsuccessful. See the instructions for undertaking a Docker volume backup in the section above.\\n    \\n7.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step is destructive and cannot be undone, please ensure that the backup is correct and saved securely before proceeding - see instructions above. Delete the volume storing your Postgres database, replacing `speckle-server_postgres-data` with the name of your Postgres volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume rm speckle-server_postgres-data\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n#### [#](#upgrading-postgres)\\n Upgrading Postgres\\n\\n1.  If you installed Postgres using Docker Compose, please log into the machine in which you installed it.\\n    \\n2.  Using `git`, clone the Speckle Server repository. More details instructions are available in GitHub\\'s documentation.\\n    \\n        git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.\\n    \\n        cd speckle-server\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Check out the version of Speckle Server you wish to deploy. For example, using `git` on the command line to checkout a tagged version - in this case Speckle Server version `2.9.0` (please change to the [latest released version (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/releases)\\n    , or the version you wish to deploy):\\n    \\n        git checkout tags/2.9.0 -b main\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Deploy the docker-compose file with the updated Postgres version:\\n    \\n        docker compose -f ./docker-compose-deps.yml up --detach\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  Verify everything is up and running by viewing the status of all containers:\\n    \\n        docker ps\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n### [#](#restoring-your-data-to-postgres-from-pgadmin-backup)\\n Restoring your Data to Postgres from pgAdmin Backup\\n\\n1.  If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake steps to move the file your local machine or storage location to the host machine (Droplet).

Connect to pgAdmin using the instructions above.\\n    \\n4.  Connect pgAdmin to the server using the instructions above.\\n    \\n5.  Right-click `databases` from the browser window, and click `create`. The name of the database should be `speckle`.\\n    \\n6.  Right-click the created database and click `restore`, selecting your previously stored backup. You will need to upload the backup you previously downloaded back into pgAdmin first.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/06_pgadmin_restore.85bf2552.png)\\n    \\n7.  If you encounter errors at this point, it may be because pgAdmin considers the database to be a `maintenance database`. To workaround this issue please try the following:\\n    \\n    1.

They function like ordinary OAuth access tokens, and they enable a script, an app, or any other piece of code to **act on your behalf**.\\n\\nThis means that with a token, an app or script is able to:\\n\\n*   read any streams you have access to\\n*   create streams on your behalf\\n*   share those streams with other users\\n*   create commits against a stream you have write access to\\n*   read the profile (public information) of other users.\\n\\nSecurity advisory\\n\\nTreat any personal access tokens like a password: do not post them anywhere where they could be accessed by others (e.g., public repos).\\n\\n[#](#creating-a-token)\\n Creating a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, you need to login and go to your profile (/profile). Just under \"Your Apps\" section, you will see a list of all the personal access tokens that you have created so far, and you\\'ll be able to create a new one.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens1.dfd285b0.png)\\n\\nTo create a new token, click on the new token button. A dialog will appear that will ask you for some basic details about it.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens2.ad8a0c88.png)\\n\\nThe token name should be something that you can remember. The token scopes define what actions can be taken with that specific token.\\n\\nToken Scopes\\n\\nIt\\'s good practice to limit the scopes to minimum required ones. For example, if you\\'re creating a script or app that just **reads** from streams, and doesn\\'t need to create new ones, or edit existing ones, just assign it the `streams:read` scope.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens3.09032568.png)\\n\\nOnce your token is created, the dialog will display it. This is the first and last time you will be able to see the full token and you should store it somewhere safe now.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens4.2dbb6491.png)\\n\\n[#](#using-a-token)\\n Using a Token\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you have a token, you usually will need to pass it as an authorization header in any server bound requests.\\n\\nFor example, here is a simple request to get the total count of your streams using javascript:\\n\\n    let res = await fetch(\\'/graphql\\', {\\n      method: \\'POST\\',\\n      headers: {\\n        Authorization: \\'Bearer \\' + token, // <- Passing in the token!\\n        \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'\\n      },\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ user { id streams { totalCount } } }` })\\n    })\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n\\nNote that the token needs to be prefixed with the word `Bearer`; a full token would look like `Bearer xxx`.\\n\\n[#](#revoking-a-token)\\n Revoking a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'re no longer using a token, or you think it may be compromised (did you commit it by accident to a public github repo?), you can revoke a token. It will be completely disabled and no more actions will be able to be taken with it.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nAs soon as possible afterwards, make sure any scripts or apps using that token did not break!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/tokens.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 9/6/2022, 12:01:02 PM\\n\\n← [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html) [Creating Your Own App](/dev/apps.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)', metadata={'title': 'Personal Access Tokens | Speckle Docs', 'description': 'Documentation on everything Speckle', 'ogLocaleAlternate': [], 'sourceURL': 'https://speckle.guide/dev/tokens'}),\n",

If you're looking for info on how to _use_ Speckle, check our [user guide](/)\\n.\\n\\n> Speckle is the open source data platform for architecture, engineering, and construction. It liberates your data from proprietary file formats and closed source software and puts it back into your hands.\\n\\nThis part of our docs is for any developer planning to extend, integrate or improve Speckle. We'll walk you through the main concepts behind our tech and guide you through fun tasks such as [writing your own connector](/dev/connectors-dev)\\n or [writing custom Speckle apps](/dev/apps)\\n.\\n\\nWe hope to see the great things you'll do with our SDKs and APIs, let's go!\\n\\n[#](#speckle-the-platform)\\n Speckle, The Platform\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe call Speckle a data platform but Speckle is also a set of connectors for AEC applications. There are Speckle kits, which are the base of our approach to interoperability. Then there are various Speckle apps - like the Speckle 3D viewer, the Speckle Web UI, the Speckle Server...\\n\\nThat's quite a lot to chew, but you're probably still asking yourself - **what is Speckle**?\\n\\n> Ultimately, Speckle has two distinct parts: the developer platform, and the applications and products built on top of it.\\n\\nSo what's what? Simple: if an architect/engineer/AEC professional interacts with it, it's a Speckle **product** built on top of Speckle's **developer platform**.\\n\\nThe developer platform consists of code that makes it easier for us (and you!) to build user-facing applications - either web-based or desktop-based.\\n\\nThis section is about the platform, and not about the products. If you want to see how to use Speckle as an architect or engineer, check our [user guide](/)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#code-repositories)\\n Code Repositories\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur platform is made of many moving parts, the code for anything Speckle 2.0 onwards is hosted in our [GitHub specklesystems organization (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems)\\n. Here's a quick summary of the main repos you'll find there, please make sure to give them a star ⭐️ if you like what you see!\\n\\n[Speckle Server (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server)\\n contains all the web-based applications including the server backend, the frontend web application, and the 3D viewer.\\n\\n    └── speckle-server\\n        ├── server\\n        ├── frontend\\n        └── viewer\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n[Speckle Sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp)\\n contains all the C# desktop components including the .NET SDK, the connectors (Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, & Dynamo...), and Objects (our default interoperability kit).\\n\\n    └── speckle-sharp\\n        ├── core\\n        ├── connector revit\\n        ├── connector rhino\\n        ├── connector dynamo\\n        ├── connector grasshopper\\n        ├── connector autocadcivil\\n        ├── desktopui\\n        └── objects\\n            ├── objects\\n            └── converters\\n                ├── revit\\n                ├── rhinogh\\n                ├── dynamo\\n                └── autocadcivil\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\nTo put it simply, Speckle Sharp is what you use to free your data from different models and desktop applications and Speckle Server is where you send all this data and interact with it in the browser.\\n\\n[Speckle Py (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-py)\\n is our Python SDK.

If you're looking for info on how to _use_ Speckle, check our [user guide](/)\\n.\\n\\n> Speckle is the open source data platform for architecture, engineering, and construction. It liberates your data from proprietary file formats and closed source software and puts it back into your hands.\\n\\nThis part of our docs is for any developer planning to extend, integrate or improve Speckle. We'll walk you through the main concepts behind our tech and guide you through fun tasks such as [writing your own connector](/dev/connectors-dev)\\n or [writing custom Speckle apps](/dev/apps)\\n.\\n\\nWe hope to see the great things you'll do with our SDKs and APIs, let's go!\\n\\n[#](#speckle-the-platform)\\n Speckle, The Platform\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe call Speckle a data platform but Speckle is also a set of connectors for AEC applications. There are Speckle kits, which are the base of our approach to interoperability. Then there are various Speckle apps - like the Speckle 3D viewer, the Speckle Web UI, the Speckle Server...\\n\\nThat's quite a lot to chew, but you're probably still asking yourself - **what is Speckle**?\\n\\n> Ultimately, Speckle has two distinct parts: the developer platform, and the applications and products built on top of it.\\n\\nSo what's what? Simple: if an architect/engineer/AEC professional interacts with it, it's a Speckle **product** built on top of Speckle's **developer platform**.\\n\\nThe developer platform consists of code that makes it easier for us (and you!) to build user-facing applications - either web-based or desktop-based.\\n\\nThis section is about the platform, and not about the products. If you want to see how to use Speckle as an architect or engineer, check our [user guide](/)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#code-repositories)\\n Code Repositories\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur platform is made of many moving parts, the code for anything Speckle 2.0 onwards is hosted in our [GitHub specklesystems organization (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems)\\n.

You\\'ll be ready to make the most out of what Speckle has to offer.\\n\\nYou will know how you could create your own backend to Speckle, how data flows and how you can control those flows, how data is stored, as well as how applications interact with Speckle and can use it as a data persistence framework.\\n\\nSpeckle is the open source data platform built for the AEC industry. What does this platform do? Put simply, Speckle consists of a set of infrastructural components needed to **store** and **retrieve** data.\\n\\n### [#](#data)\\n Data\\n\\nSome of these applications are authoring tools - such as Revit and Rhino - and other applications are SPA web apps, other more fully fledged backend apps - including scripts, serverless functions, etc.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/unfold.e179bf8d.png)\\n\\nThese applications, in order to talk to each other and make sense of the data they are consuming, need to speak a common language. The design and principles of this common language are centred around **composability** and **extensibility,** and **not** around **completeness**. This makes Speckle much more approachable than, for example, IFC.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\n[Here\\'s an article](/dev/base)\\n through how we implemented this approach in our .NET SDK.\\n\\n[#](#kits)\\n Kits\\n----------------\\n\\nA Speckle kit is, essentially, the definition of a common language: a schema. Moreover, a Speckle kit also contains the translation routines to and from an application\\'s native object model to the kit\\'s schema. Kits are \"hot-swappable\": Speckle comes with one by default which delivers the core of our interoperability capabilities. Nevertheless, anyone can define their own kit to serve their purpose.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/kits.e6428454.png)\\n\\nExisting authoring applications, such as Rhino, Revit, Autocad, send and receive data from and to Speckle by passing it through the conversion routines of a given kit. This is handled through **connectors.** Connectors are plugins that integrate within these host applications (e.g., the Rhino Connector) and allow end-users to select the data they want to send to Speckle, and, behind the scenes, convert it and, lastly, transport it to Speckle.\\n\\nExtra Reading\\n\\nRead more about **kits** [here](/dev/kits)\\n. If curious, you can also follow up with the discussion on [our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/introducing-kits-2-0/710)\\n.\\n\\nWe also have a guide on how to write your own **connector** - [check it out](/dev/connectors-dev.html)\\n!\\n\\nOther applications do not necessarily need to do so: they can directly use a kit\\'s schema - or simply use objects that respect the few low-level constraints that Speckle needs to serve its purpose. These aspects are described below in [Serialisation & Structure](#serialisation-structure)\\n. Next, we\\'re going to discuss how the serialisation layer interacts with the storage layer.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-storage)\\n Serialisation and Storage\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce Speckle data is translated or directly created, it needs to be serialised and, lastly, stored. In reverse, data needs to be retrieved from the storage layer and de-serialised to a memory representation that can be used by the application it was received in (either converted back to host application representations, or consumed by the business logic of the app. During the process of serialisation, Speckle also needs to decompose objects into their constituent parts; similarly, it needs to re-compose them during the de-serialisation process.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/serialisation.7d9aa653.png)\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper into Speckle\\'s decomposition and re-composition procedures, we will first take a look at how the storage layer is handled in Speckle and the flexibility it offers.\\n\\n[#](#transports)\\n Transports\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDifferent storage systems have various characteristics that make them better (or more ill) suited for different scenarios. This is why, rather than employ a unique storage system, Speckle uses an intermediary abstraction layer: transports. A transport defines the way Speckle writes to, and reads from, a given persistence layer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/transports.65882822.png)\\n\\nOne such transport is the Speckle Server Transport. Another transport is an SQLite Transport. Speckle comes with a couple of other transports too: a MongoDB transport, an In-Memory Transport, as well as a Disk Transport. Other transports, such as an S3 transport, a MySQL transport could easily be developed.\\n\\nThe Disk Transport writes and reads your Speckle data from files in a location you specify, while the SQLite Transport does the same, but backed by a SQLite database. For example, the latter is used extensively throughout our connectors as a local cache so as to reduce the dependency on a high-latency transport, namely the one for the Speckle Server.\\n\\nTransports offer developers low-level flexibility in developing, essentially, their own custom back-ends to Speckle, or pushing data to other systems that can do different things - even a whole new Speckle Server.\\n\\nMoreover, send operations are no longer restricted to one single location: Speckle allows you to send data, in parallel, to multiple transports. For example, data can be sent to two different Server Transports at the same time, one being an internal server and one being an external one - a different stakeholder involved in the process.\\n\\nAlternatively, a plugin based on Speckle could be developed that acts much more like git, writing data to a local folder that resides right next to the source file itself. This enables, in whatever configuration you see fit, a local only usage of Speckle, with pushing to remotes being a secondary, optional operation.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\nA work-in-progress guide on how to write your own transport can be found [here](transports-dev)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-structure)\\n Serialisation and Structure\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore data can be persisted to a storage system, it needs to be serialised. Serialisation is the process by which an object is converted into a state that can be stored or transmitted, and be reconstructed later from (deserialisation).\\n\\nObjects are, by their nature, structured data. The object graph and, implicitly, its structure, gives it meaning. Serialising a whole object graph in a naive way would result into a large blob which would be difficult to work with, and exclude certain workflows - such as reading just subsets of the graph, or individual objects - without deserialising the whole structure first. Storage systems, such as databases, work best with what we call \"flat\" data: individual rows, each corresponding to a given object.\\n\\nSpeckle solves this structural impedance mismatch by deconstructing an object into its individual constituent parts during the process of serialisation. These individual objects are then sent for storage to any given transports.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/deconstruction.c0422666.png)\\n\\nEach object, when serialised, gets a unique id which is generated by hashing its value. This means that all objects are immutable: if they change throughout their lifecycle, they get a new hash.\\n\\nThese object hashes are also used to assemble, for each individual object, its internal graph references. What this means, essentially, is that each Speckle object contains the information needed for reconstructing its full graph of descendants - alongside its own data.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/reconstruction.4927e890.png)\\n\\nAt the heart of `git` there are two types of objects: trees and blobs. Blobs represent the files themselves, and trees represent the file structure. **Objects in Speckle are, essentially, both a tree and a blob at the same time** - the \"blob\" being the value of the object itself, and the tree representing its object graph. While git sources its tree from the folder structure of your project, Speckle sources it from the object graph itself.\\n\\nWhen deserialising data, Speckle reconstructs it at the same time. This means that data can reside and make use of the upsides of storage systems such as relational databases, while at the same time, developers are not constrained as to how they structure it and can continue working with it freely inside their applications.\\n\\nAnother important note is that Speckle uses JSON as the native serialisation format for the object \"blobs\".

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-the-base-object/782)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe Base object is one of the smallest, yet most critical parts of our SDKs as it influences the serialisation & deserialisation process, hashing speed & correctness, overall performance, and how elements are defined in the Speckleverse. It\\'s the building block of Speckle.\\n\\nIn this page we\\'ll describe what it is and how to use it in more detail. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#using-base)\\n Using `Base`\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe base object class (actually called `Base`) is the foundation of all data being transferred with Speckle. Any custom data structure that you want to transfer via Speckle should inherit from it. You can read more on creating your own schemas in the [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n\\n`Base` inherits from a C# dynamic object. This allows us to be strongly typed when needed, but as well fall back elegantly on dynamic properties when we want to, or need to. Imagine a crossover between a JavaScript object and a strongly defined C# class. It\\'s quite cool! Furthermore, this removes some of the friction in aligning with our Python and JS implementations.\\n\\nThis is what it looks like:\\n\\n    // Simplified class definition:\\n    public class Base {\\n    \\tpublic string id { get; set; } // this is the unique hash, generated from the serialized object\\n        \\tpublic string applicationId { get; set; } // a secondary (optional) identity value, for example the host application object id\\n    \\tpublic string speckle_type { get; } // this is the discriminator comprised of assembly name and inheritance\\n    \\tpublic long totalChildrenCount { get; } // this is the total number of detachable objects\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n### [#](#direct-usage)\\n Direct Usage\\n\\nHere\\'s how you would use a \"raw\" `Base` object as a custom data structure. It\\'s essentially just a dynamic object at heart.\\n\\n    var myObject = new Base();\\n    \\n    // setting properties using dot notation requires cast to dynamic\\n    ((dynamic)myObject).myNewProperty = \"foo\";\\n    \\n    // alternatively, just pretend it\\'s a dictionary!\\n    myObject[\"myNewProperty2\"] = \"bar\";\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nYou can define singular objects like this - like something representing a built element; alternatively you can define your own object collection types based on the source application you\\'re working from.\\n\\n    var myCommit = new Base();\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A\"] = new List<Base>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-B\"] = new List<Point>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A:RhinoLayer-C\"] = new List<String>() { ... };\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n✋ All property names will need to be serializable and some characters prevent this. With dot notation this is more obvious, but using the dictionary method, invalid prop names will only show up at serialization time. There is a helper function `IsPropNameValid` within `DynamicBase` that you could use to check whenever you are dealing with handling indeterminate properties from other software. It also checks for double special characters or overwritten instance property names.\\n\\n### [#](#inherited-usage)\\n Inherited Usage\\n\\nOf course, you can define custom classes that inherit from `Base` and define strongly typed properties in there, which can then be accessed as usual; these can easily coexist alongside dynamic ones.\\n\\n    public class Point : Base {\\n      // define a set of strongly typed properties\\n      public double x { get; set; }\\n      public double y { get; set; }\\n      public double z { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Strongly typed props behave as you would expect them to:\\n    var myPt = new Point();\\n    myPt.x = 10;\\n    var whatIsX = myPt.x;\\n    \\n    // With a dynamic property, things are a bit more verbose, but still manageable:\\n    ((dynamic)myPt).bar = \"baz\";\\n    var whatIsBar = ((dynamic)myPt).bar as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    // Alternative syntax, if you actually pass the property name at runtime:\\n    var whatIsBar = myPt[\"bar\"] as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nSetting a dynamic property that overlaps with a strongly typed one will actually just set the strongly typed one 🙂\\n\\nAll kit object models are inheriting from the `Base` object class for their object definitions. This ensures that Speckle will be able to transport them!\\n\\n[#](#detaching)\\n Detaching @\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen defining your dynamic `Base` object properties, you can detach them by prepending an `@` to your property name like so:\\n\\n    public class Foo : Base { }\\n    public class Bar : Base { }\\n    \\n    var foo = new Foo();\\n    var bar = new Bar();\\n    \\n    foo[\"@bar\"] = bar;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nDetaching a property stores that property value as a reference to another object. Why do this? Since it\\'s possible to nest your `Base` inherited class objects, detaching any properties that may be assigned an object used by other objects keeps your data squeaky clean. Since detached objects are only serialized once during transport, detaching when appropriate means faster sending and receiving times as well ⚡\\n\\nFor a more in depth rundown of detachables and examples, check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#hashing)\\n Hashing\\n----------------------\\n\\nAs you may or may not know, objects in Speckle are immutable. That means that if you change a property of one, it essentially gets a whole new identity; it\\'s a whole new object (as far as the storage layer is concerned). This immutability is enforced through unique hashes that are dependent on the object\\'s properties.\\n\\nAs a developer, you don\\'t need to care about all this 🙌. Our SDKs takes care of correctly setting the hash of an object, at the correct time: at the end of the serialisation process. There\\'s another purely cosmetic change that we made: the hash is now stored in an field called `id`. Why? Mostly so it\\'s clear that it\\'s the single object identity mechanism that **should** be used across all storage layers.\\n\\nWhat about operations that are dependent on hashes? From our analysis of existing programmatic usage, you rarely really need the hash of an object before serialising (and, implicitly, storing it somewhere). When retrieving objects from \"somewhere\" (more on this in another post), the hash already exists, so you can check against an existing application state and manage updates.\\n\\n    var x = myObject.id; // will be populated only if this object has been previously serialised!\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIf you really need the hash (id!) before serialising it, don\\'t panic! You can still generate it - nevertheless we\\'ve put that behind an explicit function call so you, as a developer, are aware of the extra cost that you will be incurring. Here\\'s how the signature of that function looks like:\\n\\n    /// <summary>\\n    /// Gets the id (a unique hash) of this object. ⚠️ This method fully serializes the object, which in the case of large objects (with many sub-objects), has a tangible cost.\\n    /// <para><b>Hint:</b> Objects that are retrieved/pulled from a server/local cache do have an id (hash) property pre-populated.</para>\\n    /// <para><b>Note:</b>The hash of a decomposed object differs from the hash of a non-decomposed object.</para>\\n    /// </summary>\\n    /// <param name=\"decompose\">If true, will decompose the object in the process of hashing.</param>\\n    /// <returns></returns>\\n    public string GetId(bool decompose = false) { }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nNoticed that `decompose` flag? You\\'re sharp - check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n for more.\\n\\n[#](#the-speckle-objects-kit)\\n The Speckle Objects Kit\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur SDKs come with our in-house Objects Kit comprised of `Base` inherited classes for your standard AEC needs. The core geometry kit contains all your basic elements like Points, Lines, Curves, and Breps, which are then used as properties for our more extensively defined BIM, Structural, and Civil elements. Read more in our [Objects section](/dev/objects)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#displaying-base)\\n Displaying `Base`\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to the `Base` properties in our model above, you may also encounter certain common properties when exploring your data in our web viewer. The objects in our Objects Kit come with properties that we use to display them in our frontend:\\n\\n    // Class definition with additional display properties\\n    public class Foo : Base {\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; } // Mesh objects that represent the geometry of this Base object, e.g. used to render surfaces, or solid objects in our viewer\\n    \\t// or\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic Polyline displayValue { get; set; } // a polyline used to render complex curve objects in our viewer\\n    \\t\\n    \\tpublic Box bbox { get; set; } // a bounding box used to assist with object selection in our viewer\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is a **special property** within the Objects kit. It is common for classes inheriting `Base` to represent complex, conceptual, or domain specific objects. The `displayValue` property can be used to provide a **geometric representation** to help display the object in applications that don\\'t have a native form.\\n\\nFor example, When receiving **BIM types** like `Wall`, `Floor`, `Beam`, etc into a **non-BIM application** like Rhino, Unity, or our web viewer, these applications **have no way of rendering these elements natively**. The `displayValue` property represents **fallback** geometry, that will automatically be used by applications when receiving types without a native conversion.\\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is expected to be either an **object inheriting `Base`** or a **`List` of objects inheriting `Base`**. Ideally, these types **should be simple geometry types** like `Mesh` or `Polyline` as these can be converted in all (or almost all) receiving applications (However, this rule isn\\'t enforced for custom `Base` objects, and in theory, any type inheriting `Base` can be used .)\\n\\n[#](#collections)\\n Collections\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhether to represent Layers, Categories, Tags, Collections, Groups, or hierarchical containers, it is common to see a natural grouping of objects within a 3D model. The `Collection` type provides a unified way to represent hierarchical collections of Speckle objects in a queryable, filterable way and is useful for interoperability between applications.\\n\\nA collection object only has three properties (in addition to those inherited from the `Base` Speckle object) and is completely kit/domain agnostic.\\n\\n> `name` - Any (non-empty) human-readable `string` name, one not necessarily unique.\\n> \\n> `collectionType` - Any `string` value describing the type of collection, used for convenience, and specific interop.\\n> \\n> `elements` - A `List<Base>` representing child objects, may include nested `Collection` objects.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur new front-end (fe2) is designed to display `Collection` in the scene explorer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/fe2-collections.4509cd2c.gif)\\n\\nSuppose we look at how Collection objects are used inside Speckle versions. We see within the Collection’s `elements` property; we can expect any objects to be nested, including sub-collections.\\n\\nImportantly, however, we only see `Collection` objects nested under other `Collections`. Unlike other speckle objects which may form any [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n structure, Collections must be in a true directed tree structure.\\n\\n> ![](/assets/img/collection-tree-structure.2601314c.png)\\n> \\n> Diagram of collections within a Speckle commit, illustrating collections can contain both sub-collections and other objects under the `elements` property. While the `elements` property of geometry objects do not contain Collections\\n\\nWith the exception of the Revit connector, connectors will send `Collection`s from the layer/tag/collection structure.\\n\\n| Rhino | Blender | Sketchup |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| ![](/assets/img/rhino-collections.cbb5593a.png) | ![](/assets/img/blend-collections.a23747e7.png) | ![](/assets/img/skp-collections.26fa690d.png) |\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/base.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Architecture](/dev/architecture.html) [Decomposition API](/dev/decomposition.html)\\n →',\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-decomposition-api/911)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers how Speckle deals with the structure and composition of design data. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#blobs-and-trees)\\n Blobs and Trees\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nDesign and construction data is mostly relational: **built elements link to each other.** Despite this, there is no canonical way of structuring it. How do they relate to each other? Well, it depends!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/cb099e4d3a8553053869d791f0ce1fcaebca3c7a_2_690x295.png)\\n\\nFor example, a `Site` object may contain one or more `Building` objects. These, in turn, may contain one more `Levels`, and each of these `Levels` may contain some `Walls`, `Floor` and `Beam` elements. Or, those `Building` objects may each individually reference the same `Site`. Within the `Building` object, there\\'s all the `Walls` and `Beams`, and each of them, rather than being grouped under a `Level`, they individually reference a specific `Level`.\\n\\nIn order to solve this, we\\'ve taken a good look at how git, the ubiquitous version control system, works. Git operates with two object types: blobs and trees. Blobs represent files, and an important characteristic is that they are immutable - just like objects are in Speckle. Trees represent folders, and they are used to track the hierarchy of the folder structure of your repository.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you think this analogy hints to more, you\\'re right: Speckle is becoming a fully fledged version control system for design data. Keep an eye out 😎\\n\\nAs opposed to Git, that deals with data structured on your hard drive, Speckle deals with data structured in memory. In Speckle, an object is, at the same time, both a blob (data) and a tree (its subcomponents). There are two separate, yet interweaved, problems (and their corollaries) that I\\'ll now address:\\n\\n*   How to decompose an object? _(Corollary: how to recompose an object?)_\\n*   How to serialise, transport and store that decomposed object? _(Corollary: how to retrieve and deserialise an object?)_\\n\\n[#](#decomposing)\\n Decomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong way to structure design data. Different applications operate with different models, different use-cases require different hierarchies, different disciplines and professionals operate with differently structured ontologies.\\n\\nSpeckle now has a mechanism by which, in the process of specifying an object - either via a strongly typed kit, or via dynamic properties - developers (and end-users) can decide what gets decomposed and what doesn\\'t.\\n\\n### [#](#strongly-typed-detachment)\\n Strongly Typed Detachment\\n\\nIt works, in the case of strongly typed properties, by adding the Speckle specific attribute `[DetachProperty]` on the properties you want to store as references, rather than within the object itself.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s take an imaginary set of classes:\\n\\n    public class Building : Base {\\n      [DetachProperty] // this attribute tells Speckle to store the value of the Site separately.\\n      public Site Site { get; set; }\\n      public List<Level> Levels { get; set; }\\n      public Owner { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public class Level : Base {\\n      public double height { get; set; } = 3.2;\\n      public double baseElevation {get; set; } = 0;\\n    \\n      [DetachProperty]\\n      public List<Base> Elements { get; set; } // The actual walls, floors, columns, etc.\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Define a site globally\\n    var mySite = new Site();\\n    \\n    // Reference the same site in both buildings.\\n    buildingA.Site = mySite;\\n    buildingB.Site = mySite;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nWhen an instance of the Building class gets saved, the `Site` will be stored separately. If two Buildings share the same `Site`, it will be stored only once, and each instance of the `Building` class will hold a reference to the same `Site`.\\n\\nIn our example, each Level can hold, in a _detachable_ property, all its walls, beams, ducts, pipes, furniture, and other built elements. Consequently, each of these elements will be individually accessible from the storage layer, and will maintain topological unity. Why is this important? Let\\'s imagine a building with a series of levels separated by floor slabs. **The slab between two levels pertains to which level: the bottom one, or the top one?**\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/original/1X/3ea9d660024d5f3545933133165737e063fa87d5.png)\\n\\nCollections\\n\\nThe most generic class used in Speckle is the `Collection` class. The `Collection` class is a `Base` class that has the `elements` property, which is a `List<Base>`. This means that any object that inherits from `Base` can be stored in a `Collection` object. This is a very powerful concept, as it allows us to store arbitrary data structures in Speckle, without paying any penalties. While it is mostly used for representing parent-child relationships, those children can be of any type, and because `elements` is detached they can also be stored in multiple collections.\\n\\n### [#](#dynamic-detachment)\\n Dynamic Detachment\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this through an example that also demonstrates how dynamically added properties can be detached. We\\'ll assume that we will dynamically set `topSlab` and `bottomSlab` properties to each level in our imaginary object model:\\n\\n    // We\\'re grossly simplifying in this example. Here are our two building levels:\\n    var level_1, level_2;\\n    \\n    // The philosophical slab instance. Does it belong to level 1 or level 2?\\n    var slab_between_1_and_2 = new Slab();\\n    \\n    // Well, it belongs to both! Notice the \"@\" character at the beginning of\\n    // the dynamic property assignment - it\\'s the Speckle convention for \"detaching\"\\n    // dynamically added properties.\\n    level_1[\"@topSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    level_2[\"@bottomSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nBecause we\\'ve prepended the property name with an \"@\" symbol, Speckle will now \"detach\" it. Consequently, once stored, both level one and two will now hold a reference to a single slab! Beyond storage efficiency - the slab is only stored once - **this approach gives us the freedom to structure data however is best and, simultaneously, query, slice and dice it however we need to.**\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s assume you need to do a quantity takeoffs:\\n\\n*   For each each individual level: specify the total surface area, including walls, ceilings, etc. Solution: simply retrieve each level individually!\\n*   For the whole building: calculate the total volume of concrete that goes into the slabs. Solution: just query the building object for all the slabs!\\n\\nSimilarly, imagine you\\'ve written a script that does environmental analysis on a given level. The level can now be retrieved in its entirety - without juggling around to bring in the level above it too, just to get the ceiling out. Once the results are calculated, they can be stored in a detachable property on that specific level (e.g., `level_1[@\"solarComfortMeshWithColours\"] = analysisResultMesh;`). Later down the line in your workflow, one can could query for all the \"`solarComfortMeshWithColours`\" objects individually for each level, or, if needed, for the whole building.\\n\\n[#](#recomposing)\\n Recomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nRecomposition of an object happens within the deserialisation process, and it\\'s tightly integrated with the transport layer. The process, on the surface, is deceivingly simple. When you ask Speckle to receive a specific object, the process is as follows:\\n\\n*   Speckle retrieves said object\\'s \"blob\" (actually a JSON string representation of it),\\n*   Next up, Speckle retrieves at all the reference tree of this object,\\n*   Speckle proceeds to deserialise and re-compose the parent object, inserting in the place of references the actual referenced object.\\n\\nWether or not this sounds complicated, the exposed API is actually rather simple and the end result is that a decomposed object, when received back, will be identical with the original one - with all its parts in place 💥\\n\\n[#](#chunking)\\n Chunking\\n------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#problem)\\n Problem\\n\\nSome list properties of various objects can get very large. Examples:\\n\\n*   a Brep with many faces will have a Surfaces list prop containing 1000s of potentially heavy Surfaces.\\n*   a mesh with 100k+ vertices and faces.\\n\\nThis results in a clunky (memory heavy) serialisation process and can be unsafe (read: cause breakages) due to memory limitations.\\n\\n### [#](#solutions)\\n Solutions\\n\\nIn order of preference. Note that they are not exclusive, and they build on top of each other:\\n\\n*   First, optimise the list property so it\\'s more lightweight\\n*   Second, chunk the list property\\n\\n### [#](#first-port-of-call-optimise-the-list-property-🧪)\\n First Port of Call: Optimise the List Property 🧪\\n\\nFor example, you might be tempted to define a mesh like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        public List<Point> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nA much more efficient way is to define it like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n      // Typed array of 3\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\nInstead of storing each individual vertex as a point, you store them in a typed array. Serialisation will be much faster and leaner.\\n\\n### [#](#second-port-of-call-use-the-chunkable-attribute-🆕)\\n Second Port of Call: Use the `Chunkable` Attribute 🆕\\n\\nIn some cases you might be too lazy to actually optimise the storage of a list property, or it might be too convenient to use the class itself.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might still have a simple `List<double>` that expands to millions+ of items, like in the case of a very large mesh.\\n\\nIn the cases above, the best way is to mark the property as `Chunkable` together with `[DetachProperty]`. This will tell the serialiser that it should split it into manageable chunks of items, the size of which you can control.\\n\\nHere\\'s how that looks like currently in the mesh class:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> faces { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> colors { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> textureCoordinates { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nPotential Footguns\\n\\nThe DetachProperty attribute by itself can be a performance footgun in some scenarios: for example, if you have a `List<Point>` that can grow really big and you mark it as detachable, without marking it as chunkable, each individual point in that list will be stored as a separate entity.\\n\\nThis is bad: serialisation and deserialisation will take longer, and it essentially amounts to bad object model design (in speckle terms of course).\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nEnd users and developers can now productively control the way they structure their design data through the decomposition mechanism. From the point of view of the future Speckle connectors, this will enable us to expose object model flexibility in a more elegant way than before to end users. As developers, Speckle gives you another powerful API on top of which you can scaffold your digital automation workflows.\\n\\nMore importantly, this allows you to store arbitrary data structures (scaffolded on top of a `Base`) with Speckle, without paying any penalties: **Speckle deals equally well with flat and nested data.**\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/decomposition.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [The Base Object](/dev/base.html) [Kits](/dev/kits.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-transports/919)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers what Transports are and do and the basic concepts behind them. [Here can read how to write your own transport](/dev/transports-dev)\\n. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most common use-cases we\\'ve encountered throughout the past 5 years of interacting with developers from the AEC space is \"dumping data somewhere\", and, obviously, getting it back out again. While this can, of course, be done by using the Speckle server, some situations call for a different storage type or database. We\\'ve seen people looking to use files on a network drive, Azure SQL provisions, MongoDB, Excel files, and sometimes [core rope memory (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory)\\n (joking, we\\'ve never seen that one - yet!).\\n\\nAn important part of our mission at Speckle is to empower developers across AEC. We want to give you a leg up so you can \"automate all the things\" and build powerful applications that leverage modern tech.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports give developers in the AEC space full control over where and how their data is stored.\\n\\nYou can now switch, choose and mix various storage layers. This allows us to write better, more memory efficient and predictable connectors. It also allows you, as a developer, to use Speckle as a springboard in your development work in a much more flexible way.\\n\\n[#](#definitions)\\n Definitions\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we dive in and see how they work, let\\'s get some definitions out of the way:\\n\\n### [#](#transports-2)\\n Transports\\n\\nIn Speckle, transports take Speckle Objects from memory and persist it to a specific storage layer. Of course, they\\'re also responsible for taking those objects out of the storage layer and back into memory.\\n\\n### [#](#storage-layers)\\n Storage Layers\\n\\nThe storage layer that a transport writes to can be, ultimately, anything you want it to be. The .NET SDK implements already a few of them, specifically:\\n\\n*   an SQLite Transport\\n*   an In-Memory Transport\\n*   **a Speckle Server 2.0 Transport**\\n*   a Disk Transport\\n*   a MongoDB Transport\\n\\nOther possible targets for transports can be S3 storage, a network drive, etc. You can also write a transport that writes to more than one place, but we advise against it - the .NET SDK provides a better way to achieve the same thing.\\n\\nMoreover, in the case of disk based transports (ie, disk, sqlite, etc.) you can also **control the location** of where this data is stored.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data-serialisation-and-writing)\\n Sending Data: Serialisation and Writing\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSerialisation is a potentially quite wasteful operation depending on the size of the data. One of our goals is to be able to support arbitrarily large models without adding too much overhead.\\n\\n> Why can serialisation be wasteful, especially in terms of memory usage? Imagine you have a model with 100k building objects (geometry & data) open in an application. To send that model to Speckle, we would need to (1) convert those objects into Speckle objects, using a given converter, then (2) serialise them to whatever format we\\'d be ingesting down the line (e.g., a JSON string), and, finally, (3) transport them to Speckle. Over the course of these steps, your computer\\'s memory holds **_three_** representations of the same object - Native, Speckle, and String. Not that cool! To reduce memory overhead, Speckle now integrates serialisation with writing objects to one or more persistence layers via transports. Whenever an object finishes serialisation, it\\'s sent to a transport for storage, and ultimately, its string representation gets \"garbage collected\". Just like this, we\\'ve knocked off some memory usage.\\n\\nThe 2.0 API exposes two lower level methods for sending (serialising and writing) and receiving (reading and deserialising) data. In this section, we\\'ll look at only at the send one - the section below will provide more detail on receiving data.\\n\\nFirst off, let\\'s start with the simplest, default, use case:\\n\\n    // First, let\\'s create a simple base object to store our building data in.\\n    var myData = new Base();\\n    myData[\"@columns\"] = new List<Columns>() { ... the columns };\\n    myData[\"@rooms\"] = new List<Rooms>() { ... the rooms};\\n    \\n    // Let\\'s now send the data:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nLooks quite simple! In this scenario, the `Send` method serialised and saved the `myData` object, together with all its detachable `columns` and `rooms` to the default Speckle local transport (an SQLite db stored in `~/AppData/Speckle`), and returned the id (hash) of the `myData` object, which you can use to receive it back again.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at a more advanced example:\\n\\n    var myRevisionId = await Operations.Send(\\n    \\tmyData,\\n    \\ttransports: new ITransport[] {\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // imagine this one server...\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // ... and this is a different one! you\\'re basically pushing to multiple remotes!\\n    \\t  new MyCustomTransport( args ) // ... and, why not another transport?\\n      }\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening here is that we\\'re passing in multiple transports to the Send method. Speckle will persist the given object, with all its detachable sub-children, to all these transports, and, when done, return the object\\'s id (hash!).\\n\\n[#](#receiving-data-reading-and-deserialisation)\\n Receiving Data: Reading and Deserialisation\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, let\\'s start with the simplest use-case possible:\\n\\n    // To set the stage, in the previous code sample, we\\'ve done:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n    // Now, we want to get it back out. It\\'s as simple as:\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive( myDataId );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nThis just retrieves the object back using the default SQLite Transport. No accounts, no extra HTTP requests, no hassle. Of course, this is enough only for \"local\" operations that are bound to a single computer only.\\n\\nIf you want this to work across a local network, you can always create a SQLite Transport (or your own custom transport for that matter) that stores data on a network accessible drive. For large collaborative environments, you can, of course, receive your data from a Speckle Server.\\n\\nWhile you can Send data to multiple places at the same time, you can\\'t really receive data from more places at the same time. Hence, `Receive` can only accept one transport as the source:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n    \\tmyDataId,\\n    \\tremoteTransport: new ServerTransport( ... ) // where you want to receive things from!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nDone! `myData` is now your data - a nicely deserialised Base object.\\n\\n[#](#advanced-transports)\\n Advanced Transports\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Send and Receive functions in the examples above assume **a shared global cache** located in `~/User/.config/Speckle`. In the case of Send, this means that objects will be written to a SQLite Transport that is used by Speckle always; in the case of Receive, the same SQLite Transport will be used to buffer to/from the remote transport.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are some use cases where you don\\'t want to, or cannot, use the shared global cache. For example, you would want to go full on classic version control, and store your history right next to your project\\'s file:\\n\\n    `-- MyProject_A            # root folder\\n        |-- .speckle           # the \".git\" folder\\n        |   |-- references.db  # commits, branches, tags, etc. storage\\n        |   `-- objects.db     # object storage\\n        `-- MyProject_A.rvt    # source file\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nHow would you actually implement such a system?\\n\\nFirst, you can always customise the location of your transport. For example, in the case of the SQLite Transport, you can specify a folder where to actually create it. Let\\'s assume we want to send our data to only two transports, a local SQLite one that\\'s sitting in the `.speckle` folder just next to our Revit file, and a Speckle Server.\\n\\n    var customLocalTransport = new SQLiteTransport( basePath: @\"{localFolderPath}/.speckle\" );\\n    var serverTransport = new ServerTransport(...);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThe `Send` method can take an optional `useDefaultCache: false` argument to bypass the global cache, and send exclusively to the provided transports:\\n\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send(\\n      myData,\\n      transports: new ITransport[] { customLocalTransport, serverTransport },\\n      useDefaultCache: false // will bypass the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nWhen receiving data, if you want to use your custom local transport, the method would look like this:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId: myDataId,\\n      remoteTransport: serverTransport,\\n      localTransport: customLocalTransport // will use this one instead of the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nAnother use case is in constrained environments, where you don\\'t have a persistent storage layer handy, such as a serverless function, or docker container. That\\'s where you would probably want to use a `MemoryTransport` - it\\'s obviously much faster and it doesn\\'t need to touch the disk.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nTransports give you, as a developer, a lot of flexibility in how you can use Speckle, so hopefully \"automating all the things\" will become a bit easier and nicer. They make it easy to customise your workflows and where and how you store data - from the Speckle Server, to one or more databases, local or remote.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/transports.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 8/1/2021, 10:56:30 AM\\n\\n← [Kits](/dev/kits.html) [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/apps-authn-speckle-2-0/961)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a quick post on how authentication with the server works; we\\'ve put in _a lot_ of effort to make it easier for developers to extend the functionality of Speckle in their own apps, and simultaneously more secure for end users.\\n\\nBefore we start, we\\'d like to clarify that this post refers to specifically **authentication**, and not authorization.\\n\\n*   Authorization (authZ) controls **who has access to what resource**; it\\'s not the focus of this post.\\n*   Authentication (authN) controls **how a user can delegate access to other applications** (pieces of software) that then act on their behalf.\\n\\n[#](#api-tokens)\\n API Tokens\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAll access to the API is done through bearer tokens that need to present in the Authorization header of each request. There are several ways to create/obtain these tokens, which we\\'ll describe below. First, a few important notes on _tokens in general_:\\n\\n### [#](#token-scopes)\\n Token Scopes\\n\\nEach token has a set of associated scopes to it which **limit what actions it can do**. For example, you could have a token that is only allowed to read streams and your profile information. Alternatively, you could have a token that is allowed to search for other users on the server, read your existing streams, create new ones, etc.\\n\\nAs Speckle will grow with functionality, new scopes will be made available. Currently there are:\\n\\n    let coreModuleScopes = [\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"server:setup\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Edit server information.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your api tokens.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:write\",\\\\\\n        description: `Create and delete api tokens on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:read\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Read your streams & and any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:write\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Create streams on your behalf and read your streams & any associated information (any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read your profile information`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:email\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your email.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read other users\\' profile on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:email\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Access the emails of other users.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n    ];\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n\\n### [#](#token-lifetime)\\n Token Lifetime\\n\\nTokens also have a certain lifetime after which they\\'re no longer valid. This helps with automatically blocking access to long forgotten apps. Written a little script two years ago that you\\'ve totally forgot about, but the token\\'s nicely pasted in the codebase since you\\'ve never published it? Well, now that\\'s safe even if someone else somehow snitches it - it probably expired.\\n\\n[#](#personal-access-tokens)\\n Personal Access Tokens\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs a developer, you can now create personal access tokens that you can use to delegate access to your script on your behalf, similar to how Github\\'s [Personal Access Tokens (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\\n work.\\n\\nWhen you create them, you can assign assign to them whatever scopes & lifetime you want to, just remember to limit both to the minimum to be _safe._\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTo create a new token head over `YOUR-SPECKLE-SERVER\\\\profile`\\n\\n[#](#apps)\\n Apps\\n----------------\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/109046703-f45be080-76cc-11eb-83b3-27ed956ff319.png)\\n\\nOnce you\\'re beyond the hacking phase, you\\'ll probably want to create & publish a speckle app that others can use. As a developer, you can:\\n\\n*   register apps that others can use (or not),\\n*   manage the apps you have created - edit name, description, redirect url, scopes, and delete.\\n\\nOnce an app is registered on a server, users can now delegate access to it for the set of scopes that the developer registered for that application. Once the delegation process is successful - the user approves it - they will get redirected to the url that the developer specified.\\n\\nOf course, as an end user, you have full control and visibility on the apps you have authorized. You can:\\n\\n*   see all your authorized apps (apps that you have granted access to),\\n*   revoke access to any of the above,\\n*   check out any publicly listed apps on this server (optional at this stage)\\n\\n### [#](#extras-on-app-types)\\n Extras on app types:\\n\\nNote: broadly speaking, there are two type of apps:\\n\\n*   Apps that act on behalf of a user - **supported ✅**\\n*   Apps that can act with their own identity - **not currently supported ⏱**\\n\\nWe\\'ll write soon more documentation on how the authentication flow with the Server actually works. For the geeks out there, here\\'s a short summary, or some important points:\\n\\n*   We are supporting the **authorization\\\\_code** flow with **PKCE** only for public and confidential clients.\\n*   We do not support dynamic scope requests for apps. We **only support pre-registered scopes for each app**.\\n*   If an app is edited in any way - name, scopes, etc. - all its tokens get revoked and users will need to re-authorize it.\\n\\nClients are usually split into two categories: public and private. Public clients cannot realistically hold a secret, whereas private ones can. For example, a front-end only web application is a public client; same goes for the desktop connectors. A private client can be a server-side application, which can realistically store an application secret in, for example, a .env file or provide it during the CI/CD process.\\n\\nClients are protected by:\\n\\n*   Using exclusively a pre-registered redirect URL.\\n*   Native apps (desktop): registering a custom application scheme (`speckle://`).\\n*   PKCE (Proof of Key For Code Exchange).\\n*   a client id & client secret, but the clientSecret is superfluous in the case of public clients.\\n\\n[#](#examples)\\n Examples\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe 2.0 server already comes with two applications that demonstrate this flow (warning - there might still be bugs). These are:\\n\\n*   The main web frontend application - accessible at the server\\'s default url, and\\n*   The GraphQL explorer - accessible at your server\\'s url + `/explorer`.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve put a lot of work into making Speckle developer friendly and extensible - and apps are just a small part of that. We hope that writing Speckle Apps will be fun and effective, and we can\\'t wait to see what you\\'ll do with them!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/apps-auth.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Transports](/dev/transports.html) [Introduction](/dev/dotnet.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

Together with it you might find useful [Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n, our default kit.\\n\\nCore and Objects are written in .NET Standard 2.0, they\\'ve been tested on Windows and MacOS and are being used by all our .NET based connectors.\\n\\n[#](#getting-started)\\n Getting Started\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore using them [please make sure they are supported by your .NET framework (opens new window)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support)\\n.\\n\\nWe have published various NuGets to make it simpler to use Speckle in your next .NET project. Here\\'s what\\'s available at the moment:\\n\\n*   Core\\n*   All Transports\\n*   Objects\\n*   All Objects Converters\\n\\nAll our NuGets are prefixed by `Speckle.`. Please don\\'t confuse them with the old v1 packages.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/113474800-0833f880-946a-11eb-8c90-92b23918a0c8.png)\\n\\n[#](#how-to-use)\\n How to Use\\n----------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a quick summary of the main tasks Core helps you with:\\n\\n*   sending and receiving data to and from multiple transports\\n*   speckle kit management & data conversion (the interoperability core)\\n*   serialization and deserialization\\n\\nServer specific tasks:\\n\\n*   stream, branch and commit api calls\\n*   update notifications (subscriptions)\\n*   local account management\\n\\n[#](#structuring-your-data)\\n Structuring Your Data\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle allows you to structure your data in any way you like. Here\\'s a quick example:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    \\n    var myBuilding = new Base()\\n    \\n    myBuilding[ \"@floors\" ] = myFloors;\\n    myBuilding[ \"@walls\" ] = myWalls;\\n    myBuilding[ \"name\" ] = \"Southwood Park\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nThe `Base` object behaves like a dictionary - with some added Speckle smarts - and lets you organically compose your data in any way you want.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor more advanced usage, check [the tests out (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Tests/BaseTests.cs)\\n! More on `Base` [can be found here](/dev/base)\\n\\nFor advanced use of `Base`, please see how our [BuiltElement classes (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements)\\n have been structured inheriting from `Base`.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data)\\n Sending Data\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSending data to Speckle is also pretty straightforward. Assuming you have SpeckleManager set up locally, all you need to do is:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    \\n    var commitId = Helpers.Send(\"Stream URL or ID\", data, \"My commit message\").Result;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#advanced-sending)\\n Advanced Sending\\n\\nIf you want more control on how and where to your data is Sent, just use some of our lower lever functions. For instance:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Transports;\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    var streamId = \"streamId\";\\n    var branchName = \"main\";\\n    var client = new Client(account);\\n    \\n    var transport = new ServerTransport(account, streamId);\\n    \\n    var objectId = await Operations.Send(\\n      data,\\n      new List<ITransport> { transport },\\n      useDefaultCache,\\n      onProgressAction,\\n      onErrorAction, disposeTransports: true);\\n    \\n    var commitId = await client.CommitCreate(\\n      new CommitCreateInput\\n      {\\n        streamId = sw.StreamId,\\n        branchName = branchName,\\n        objectId = objectId,\\n        message = message,\\n        sourceApplication = sourceApplication,\\n        totalChildrenCount = totalChildrenCount,\\n      });\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\n[#](#receiving-data)\\n Receiving Data\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nReceiving data from Speckle couldn\\'t be easier when using our SDKs. Assuming you have SpeckleManager set up locally, all you need to do is:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    \\n    var data = Helpers.Receive(\"Stream URL or ID\").Result;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\nJust use a stream URL or Id to receive from. If the URL contains branchName, commitId or objectId those will be used, otherwise the latest commit from main will be received.\\n\\nThe `Helpers.Receive` takes optional arguments for specifying an `account` (otherwise the default will be used) and for progress/error reporting.\\n\\n### [#](#advanced-receiving)\\n Advanced Receiving\\n\\nIf you want more control on how and where from your data is Received, just use some of our lower lever functions. For instance, the code below receives the last commit of a stream from a specific branch:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Transports;\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    var streamId = \"streamId\";\\n    var branchName = \"main\";\\n    var client = new Client(account);\\n    var branch = await client.BranchGet(streamId, branchName, 1);\\n    var objectId = branch.commits.items[0].referencedObject; // take last commit\\n    \\n    var transport = new ServerTransport(account, streamId);\\n    \\n    var data = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId,\\n      remoteTransport: transport,\\n      onErrorAction: onErrorAction,\\n      onProgressAction: onProgressAction,\\n      onTotalChildrenCountKnown: onTotalChildrenCountKnown,\\n      disposeTransports: true\\n    );\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\n[#](#serializing-and-deserializing-data)\\n Serializing and Deserializing Data\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGetting a JSON representation of your data is easy:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    \\n    var json = Operations.Serialize(data);\\n    \\n    var data = Operations.Deserialize(json);\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n[#](#using-the-net-sdk-without-manager)\\n Using the .NET SDK without Manager\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCore has been designed to be used in conjunction with Manager, that\\'s where the account information is basically pulled from.\\n\\nBut you can of course also use Core in environments where Manager is not available, for example in a serverless function. To do so (and avoid worrying about authentication), we first need to set up a [personal access token](/dev/tokens)\\n.\\n\\nThen, we can create a basic `Account` and pass it to a new `Client` and use the API as usual, see full example below:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Credentials;\\n    using System;\\n    \\n    namespace SpeckleSampleApp\\n    {\\n      class Program\\n      {\\n        static void Main(string[] args)\\n        {\\n          var account = new Account();\\n          account.token = \"YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN\";\\n          account.serverInfo = new ServerInfo\\n          {\\n            url = \"https://app.speckle.systems/\"\\n          };\\n    \\n          var client = new Client(account);\\n          var stream = client.StreamGet(\"5dfbeb49c9\").Result;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nAlternatively, if you don\\'t want to use a personal access token you\\'d need to take care of the auth flow yourself, this functionality is not currently present in Core.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/dotnet.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/3/2024, 8:37:44 PM\\n\\n← [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html) [Filtering and Flattening Speckle Data in .NET](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

There is no single canonical way in which data is structured!\\n\\nGenerally, working with structured data is a bit more difficult, as you need to parse the \"graph\", or the tree that describes its structure. Nevertheless, this doesn\\'t need to be so! What if we could access all the data inside a given commit and treat it just as any other list? Well, it\\'s actually super easy!\\n\\n[#](#step-1-let-s-flatten-the-data)\\n Step 1: Let\\'s Flatten the Data\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe extension method below flattens any `Base` object into its constituent parts: it returns a list of all its sub-`Base`s. **Simply add this to your project somewhere and you\\'re good to go.**\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nOnce we test this a bit more, we\\'re probably going to add it to our Core SDK - so keep an eye out!\\n\\n    \\n    public static class Extensions\\n    {\\n      // Flattens a base object into all its constituent parts.\\n      public static IEnumerable<Base> Flatten(this Base obj)\\n      {\\n        yield return obj;\\n    \\n        var props = obj.GetDynamicMemberNames();\\n        foreach (var prop in props)\\n        {\\n          var value = obj[prop];\\n          if (value == null) continue;\\n    \\n          if (value is Base b)\\n          {\\n            var nested = b.Flatten();\\n            foreach (var child in nested) yield return child;\\n          }\\n    \\n          if (value is IDictionary dict)\\n          {\\n            foreach (var dictValue in dict.Values)\\n            {\\n              if (dictValue is Base lb)\\n              {\\n                foreach (var lbChild in lb.Flatten()) yield return lbChild;\\n              }\\n            }\\n          }\\n    \\n          if (value is IEnumerable enumerable)\\n          {\\n            foreach (var listValue in enumerable)\\n            {\\n              if (listValue is Base lb)\\n              {\\n                foreach (var lbChild in lb.Flatten()) yield return lbChild;\\n              }\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n41  \\n42  \\n43  \\n44  \\n45  \\n\\n[#](#step-2-let-s-query-the-data)\\n Step 2: Let\\'s Query the Data\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we have our flattening method in place, what can we do?

Without a method to navigate through complex, hierarchical data structures, you might end up with partial or incorrect data representations. Traversal provides a systematic way to explore Speckle data while capturing the relational context between objects.\\n\\nThe most basic way to consume Speckle objects is simply **[by flattening the Speckle data](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n**, and consuming objects one by one. For many use cases, this is all that is required, but often it is necessary to consume Speckle objects **while capturing the hierarchical context of objects**.\\n\\n**In connectors**, this means traversing received Speckle data **to find convertible objects and their children**. In these cases, we are converting more than just objects one by one, but also **preserving the hierarchical tree** of parent/child relationships.\\n\\nSo, What is Traversal?\\n\\nIn practical terms, Traversal is **how we navigate Speckle data** and the relationships between Speckle Objects, to **consume objects with hierarchical context.**\\n\\nTo be concise, traversal aims to transform the [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n topology (_Think of it as a one-way network of objects; no loops allowed_) of a Speckle data **into a pure [tree (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\\n topology** (_a branching hierarchy_).\\n\\nThe structure of a Speckle data (e.g. from a version) differs depending on the data sent and from which connector. While it is possible to write code that manually traverses a specific version, by **hardcoding assumptions** its structure, it is often desirable to **write code that can consume any Speckle data, sent from any connector**. For this, it is necessary to understand the common **rules for how the connectors structure data**, and how this data can be traversed.\\n\\nThis concept is most useful in connectors when receiving and converting data, but the concept of traversal applies for any use case with the need to preserve and transform the structure of data.\\n\\nSimply iterating through all Speckle objects and consuming them individually is insufficient. Many types of **objects contain several representations** and reference geometry objects that are part of their definition (rather than separate displayable objects).\\n\\nTo illustrate this, consider how the `Wall` object is defined:\\n\\n    public class Wall : Base\\n    {\\n        public double height { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public ICurve baseLine { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public string units { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Base> elements { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nThe `baseLine` curve forms part of the definition of the wall. And the `displayValue` provides a purely polygonal **mesh representation** of the mesh for display.\\n\\nA naïve function that consumes all objects one by one would **blindly consume** the baseline curve, and each mesh `displayValue` **without context** that it’s part of the Wall, nor do we have selectivity to choose which representation is use.\\n\\nFor these objects, it is necessary to be **selective about which properties should be traversed deeper**.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/selective-traversal.9b472fa6.png)\\n\\nWithin the Speckle connectors, **A `Wall` object is considered a convertible object**; the `baseLine` and `displayValue` representations **should be ignored** from being traversed.\\n\\nThis is where traversal functions come into play. These functions **encode the “rules” for which properties should be traversed**. And provides a convenient way to traverse Speckle data without making connector-specific assumptions about its structure.\\n\\nThe **Default Traversal Function** provides a de jure method of traversing Speckle objects, designed around a Speckle converter. This function is used by most of our connectors (with slight deviation) when receiving Speckle objects.\\n\\nIn general, a connector considers an object to be either:\\n\\n*   Convertible directly through a `ToNative` function\\n*   Convertible using displayValue (through a fall-back display value)\\n*   Convertible indirectly (through another conversion, as is the case for, say, `RenderMaterial`)\\n*   Not convertible at all\\n\\nDifferent connectors will have **different definitions of a “convertible” object**. There is no definitive list of “convertible” Speckle types. Connector-specific flexibility allows for **targeted interop** workflows and allows for the **intricacies of each host application**.\\n\\nAs part of the default traversal rules, we selectively traverse the properties of “convertible” objects. Only traversing `\"elements\"` (and its alias `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nAll other non-”convertible” objects will be traversed blindly (i.e. they have all properties traversed).\\n\\nCollections are a special case, As we handle them slightly differently depending on the connector. Some connectors (on receive) ignore all collection structures and convert objects the best way the native application allows. Others will use them to construct Layers, Tags, Collections, Groups etc.\\n\\nBe careful when dynamically attaching data to `Collection` objects to avoid inconsistent behaviour. We would advise keeping `\"elements\"` as the only traversed property. This is something we may consider enforcing in a future version of Core. This doesn’t mean you can’t use dynamic properties on collections, but it does avoid dynamically attaching geometry.\\n\\n[#](#using-the-traversal-functions)\\n Using the Traversal Functions\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor most use cases, the `DefaultTraversal` function can be used out of the box to consume Speckle objects individually while still retaining the object hierarchy (tree).\\n\\nThe below case demonstrates the `DefaultTraversal` implementation and how it can be used to iterate through the Tree. The `TraversalContext` objects are the tree nodes that contain the `current: Base` object and the `parent : TraveralContext`. Additionally, they contain the name of the parent’s property that was traversed to get to current.\\n\\n    async Task Foo(string myStream, ISpeckleConverter myConverter)\\n    {\\n        // Initialize traversal function with the given converter\\n        var traversalFunc = DefaultTraversal.CreateTraverseFunc(myConverter);\\n    \\n        // Receive commit object from the stream\\n        Base commitObject = await Helpers.Receive(myStream);\\n    \\n        // Traverse the commit object\\n        foreach (TraversalContext context in traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject))\\n        {\\n            // Get the current object in traversal\\n            Base current = context.current;\\n    \\n            // Get the parent of the current object\\n            TraversalContext? parent = context.parent;\\n    \\n            // Perform some operation on the current object\\n            // Replace `DoWork` with your actual functionality\\n            DoWork(current);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n\\nThe above code can be adapted to perform common tasks, such as\\n\\n*   Filter for walls\\n\\n    List<Wall> walls = traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .OfType<Wall>()\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n*   Filter for all objects by volume\\n\\n    List<Base> smallThings = traversalFunc\\n          .Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .Where(b => b[\"Volume\"] is double and < 20)\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n[#](#the-traversal-rule-builder)\\n The Traversal Rule Builder\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we delve into customizing traversal rules, let\\'s establish the default rules that are applied during traversal:\\n\\n**Default Traversal Rules:**\\n\\n1.  For Convertible Objects: Only the \"elements\" and its alias \"@elements\" properties are traversed.\\n2.  For Non-Convertible Objects: All properties are traversed, with no exceptions.\\n3.  For Collections: The \"elements\" property is the only one traversed, to avoid inconsistent behavior.\\n\\nNow that we understand the default behavior, let\\'s explore how you can create custom rules using the Traversal Rule Builder. The `TraversalRule` builder provides a means to construct a set of rules for how Speckle objects should be traversed. Each rule defines which properties of a Speckle object should be traversed and predicate criteria for when the rule is active for a given Speckle object.\\n\\n`GraphTraversal.Traverse(Base)` will perform a depth-first traversal of the provided commit object, adding objects into an internal stack. Rules are executed in order for the current `Base` object. The first rule, whose predicated function holds true, determines which members of said `Base` object are traversed (added to the stack).\\n\\nThe `DefaultTraversal` contains two simple rules. A rule is triggered for convertible objects (objects either convertible directly through the converter or through the existence of a `displayValue` property). For these objects, we only traverse `\"elements\"` (and `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nThe second rule, the default rule, is used for all other objects (i.e. non-convertible objects); it traverses all properties on an object (with the exception of `Obsolete` and `SchemaIgnore` members)\\n\\n    // Implementation of the default traversal function, simplified for brevity\\n    public static GraphTraversal CreateTraverseFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n    {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(converter.CanConvertToNative) //NOTE: only one `When` clause needs to evaluate true, for this rule to hold true \\n            .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(_ => true) //Always evaluates true\\n            .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers); //AllMembers returns all non-obsolete members (instance & dynamic)\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, defaultRule);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nInside the `DefaultTraversal` class, you will find another traversal function returned by `CreateRevitTraversalFunc`. This function is almost the same as the regular function. However, instead of performing a deep traversal of nested elements. Instead, it halts traversal as soon as it finds a convertible object. Deeper traversal is then performed by the Revit converter, which has more control over the hosting of nested Revit Elements.\\n\\n      public static GraphTraversal CreateRevitTraversalFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n      {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(converter.CanConvertToNative)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(None);\\n    \\n        var displayValueRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(_ => true)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers);\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, displayValueRule, defaultRule);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-don-t-use-a-converter)\\n What if I Don’t Use a Converter?\\n\\nThese functions were designed for Speckle connectors, which by design, do not reference the `Objects` assembly. Because of this, the functions are unaware of the specific object models designed to be convertible. Thus we use the `ISpeckleConverter` interface to avoid coupling of converter and connector code projects.\\n\\nHowever, other use cases may require consuming Speckle data outside of a connector/converter’s software architecture. Fear not! the traversal functions are flexible in achieving desirable behaviour. Adapting the `CreateTraverseFunction` function or engineering custom rules to achieve the desired result is possible.\\n\\nAs a quick workaround, you could substitute the `converter.CanConvertToNative` function with a simple `b => b.speckle_type.contains(\"Objects.Geometry\")`. This should handle raw geometry, and the `HasDisplayValue` predicate should handle all other types of convertible geometry. This should give you similar results to our converter’s, though there may be some edge cases where this behaves differently.\\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-custom-traversal-behaviour)\\n What if I Want Custom Traversal Behaviour?\\n\\nThe `TraverseRule` builder can be used to create **custom rules** and custom traversal behaviour. A rule is formed by specifying a number of predicate functions and a selection function to select which property name should be traversed when the rule evaluates true.\\n\\n    bool predicateFunction(Base b) {... }\\n    IEnumerable<string> memberSelectionFunction(Base b) {... }\\n        \\n    var myCustomRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(predicateFunction)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(memberSelectionFunction);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-to-capture-custom-context)\\n What if I Want to Capture Custom Context?\\n\\nThe `TraversalContext` and `GraphTraversal` classes are designed to be subclassable.

It includes geometry and element base classes as well as conversions routines for the AEC applications that we officially support. Objects uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS. You can find the code in [speckle-sharp/Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nObjects is available on NuGet as `Speckle.Objects`. All converters are also available under `Speckle.Objects.COnverter.*`.\\n\\nWhile the Objects is the default kit, you are free to develop your own kit or fork this one to customise it yourself. As of the beta release, easy swapping of kits within the connectors is not fully supported. However, this will be fully supported by the time we officially ship 2.0 🎉\\n\\nMore info on Objects and kits in 2.0 can be found in our [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#developing)\\n Developing\\n----------------------------\\n\\nObjects kit is just a set of simple data transfer objects that are fairly straightforward to understand. The object model is split into two main parts:\\n\\n*   `Geometry`: the basic building blocks such as points, lines, meshes, surfaces, etc\\n*   `BuiltElements`: higher level elements such as rooms, beams, ducts, openings, topography, etc\\n\\n### [#](#writing-objects)\\n Writing Objects\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute more [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects)\\n to the Objects kit or extend and customise the kit yourself, you can easily do so by creating new classes that inherit from `Base`. You can read more about the `Base` class [here](/dev/base)\\n. There are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nThe class itself needs to have an empty constructor for serialisation / deserialisation purposes. You can create as many additional constructors for your own use as makes sense.\\n\\nFor example, here is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n### [#](#specific-host-application-support)\\n Specific Host Application Support\\n\\nThe basic objects are intended to be as general as possible\\n\\nIn order to better support interop between the various AEC host applications and Speckle, Objects also contains classes that help to deal with native object types and their properties. These inherit from a more generic Speckle object but add additional properties that are important for specific applications, but are too specific to include in the generic object.\\n\\nFor example, [`Objects.BuiltElements.Revit` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements/Revit)\\n contains a collection of classes that extend the basic ones with a series of default Revit properties. This is the approach we\\'ll follow with other host applications as well.\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-schema-information-attributes-to-classes)\\n Adding Schema Information Attributes to Classes\\n\\nIn order for these _Host Application specific_ classes to be discoverable in any other host application (such as Grasshopper\\'s `Create Schema Object` node), this objects must contain at least one constructor with the attribute `SchemaInfo`. The attribute allows to provide human-readable names and descriptions that will be used to display to the user.\\n\\nIn addition, you can optionally add the `SchemaMainParam` attribute to one of the constructor\\'s inputs to signal it as the **main geometry parameter** for that Schema.\\n\\nHere\\'s the code for the `Objects.BuiltElements.Beam` constructor, with the `baseLine` flagged as its main parameter:\\n\\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n#### [#](#handing-breaking-changes-in-the-schema-model)\\n Handing Breaking Changes in the Schema Model\\n\\nThese information from the `SchemaInfo` attribute is used, among other places, to automatically generate all the Schema Nodes you\\'ll find in the Grasshopper Connector.\\n\\nThis means that any breaking-change on that object will have unwanted side-effects on the end-user; such as previously existing Schemas dissapearing without warning.\\n\\nIn order to prevent this, the recommended way to update is to:\\n\\n1.  Add a `SchemaDeprecated` attribute to the existing constructor, and modify it\\'s implementation if necessary.\\n2.  Create a new constructor with the new parameters and add the `SchemaInfo` attribute to it too.\\n\\nFollowing our previous `Beam` example. If we added two new properties to our beam (`width` and `height`), the final changes would look like this:\\n\\n    public double width;\\n    public double height;\\n    \\n    [SchemaDeprecated, SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = 1.0;\\n        this.width = 1.0;\\n    }\\n    \\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine, double height, double width)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = height;\\n        this.width = width;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nThis will ensure that anyone using the previous Schema definition can still do, but also provide a way to notify them that they should upgrade to the new/upgraded one.\\n\\n> These `SchemaDeprecated` constructors will eventually be deleted from the object model, but not before giving all users enough warning.\\n\\n### [#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n\\nThe Objects kit doesn\\'t just stop at Objects - you need converters as well! These can be found in [Objects/Converters (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n. Each converter is a class within the `Objects.Converter` namespace and contains conversion routines to a Speckle object and to the native software equivalent. The two key methods within a converter are predictably:\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nBoth of these core methods check if the specific type passed into it is supported by the converter, then calls the conversion method for that type accordingly.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nEach supported type has its own conversion routines. You can expand the support of a converter by adding your own conversions. Depending on the converter structure, you can do this by either adding a new partial class (Revit) or adding to the respective `ConverterX.Geometry` or `ConverterX.BuiltElements` file (RhinoGh, Dynamo, AutoCAD). As a simple example, here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#instances-transforms-and-definitions)\\n Instances, Transforms, and Definitions\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle supports object instancing across many connectors, using an abstract `Objects` class that allows for conversions between block instances in Rhino and AutoCAD, family instances in Revit, collections and geometry instances in Blender, instances in Sketchup, and more.\\n\\nWhat is an instance?\\n\\nIn Speckle, an **instance** is a single **transformation** of a detached, typed **definition** object containing _transformable geometry_.\\n\\n### [#](#instances)\\n Instances\\n\\nCheck out the [Instance class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Instance.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instances live in the `Objects.Other` namespace and are comprised of two main parts:\\n\\n1.  A detached `definition` object, which contains transformable geometry including other instances.\\n2.  A `transform` matrix indicating the transformations to be applied to the geometry inside the definition.\\n\\nConcretions of the `Instance` class can contain instance-specific properties outside of the shared definition. When scoping your own concretion, keep in mind that any properties which will be shared across instances of the same definition should belong in the `definition` class, and any properties which are specific to a single instance should be on the `Instance` class.\\n\\n**What about receiving Instances in applications that do not support instancing?**\\n\\nOur abstract `Instance` class also contains virtual `GetTransformableGeometry()` and `GetTransformedGeometry()` methods which should be overridden in concretions. These methods determine how to retrieve the transformable geometry inside the `definition` and transforms their vertices with the instance transform for use in applications which do not natively support instancing.\\n\\n### [#](#transforms)\\n Transforms\\n\\nCheck out the [Transform class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Transform.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instance transformations are stored in a `System.Numerics.Matrix4x4` typed 4x4 matrix.

The Speckle `Objects.Other.Instance : Base` class is implemented as follows:\\n\\n| Connector | Speckle Instance Class | Speckle Definition Class GitHub Link |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Rhino, AutoCAD, Sketchup, Blender | `BlockInstance : Instance <BlockDefinition>` | [BlockDefinition (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Block.cs) |\\n| Revit | `RevitInstance : Instance <RevitSymbolElementType>` | [RevitSymbolElementType (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements/Revit/RevitElementType.cs) |\\n\\n##### [#](#revit)\\n Revit\\n\\nRevit elements are parametric instances, and we use the `RevitInstance` class to send elements where (1) **no direct conversions exist** and (2) are **point-based family instances**.\\n\\nWhen sending or receiving models in Revit using the **Reference Point setting**, and when sending elements in **linked models**, the transformations of the linked model and/or reference point is applied to the top-level family instance transform only.\\n\\n**Limitations of Revit API and Instancing**\\n\\n*   Revit cannot natively support **scaling** operations in transforms. When receiving non-revit instances in Revit, we convert the transformed geometry directly and create **groups** from the converted geometry.\\n*   Due to the parametric nature of Revit elements, some instance parameters result in **changes to the definition geometry**. Since we use the `displayValue` property to create Revit elements in most of our other connectors, this means that we are currently creating `RevitSymbolElementType` definitions with varying `displayValue`s to capture these geometry changes where they occur.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/objects.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Traversing Structured Data](/dev/traversal.html) [Writing your own connector (Outdated)](/dev/connectors-dev.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

We have all the tools ready for you to start developing your own!\\n\\nWe are very enthusiastic about community connectors and would love to help you bring them to life. To get started, check out the guide below. Feel free to reach out with any questions or calls for more contributors to the project on our [forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#before-you-begin)\\n Before you Begin\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore you begin writing your own connector, we encourage you to follow the steps below:\\n\\n1.  **make sure you are comfortable** writing plugins for the host application you are planning to target, otherwise the guide below will not be of great help 😅\\n2.  **post on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n    ** announcing what you are planning to develop and how\\n3.  **consider** that if you make your connector publicly available, it\\'s going to be your own responsibility to maintain it\\n4.  **check whether the [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n     kit is fit** to support your future connector, if it might need to be extended or if you might want to develop a new kit as well\\n5.  **read** our [dev docs on Base object, kits, transports](/dev/base.html)\\n     etc...\\n\\n[#](#anatomy-of-a-connector)\\n Anatomy of a Connector\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nConnectors are made of the following parts:\\n\\n*   **a User Interface**\\n*   **bindings** between the host application and the UI\\n*   **custom logic** specific to the host application (for selecting elements, saving senders and receivers in the project file etc)\\n*   **a converter** to convert between the host application and Speckle geometry and BIM elements\\n\\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we\\'ll be using a user interface called [DesktopUI](/user/ui)\\n currently in use by our Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD and Civil 3D connectors. But you can of course create your own or use whatever the host application you are integrating with provides - that\\'s the case of visual programming software.\\n\\n[#](#getting-started)\\n Getting Started\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nTo get started, create a C# project in your IDE of choice by following the conventions and requirements for writing plugins for the host application you are targeting. In most cases you\\'ll be creating a .NET Framework class library project.\\n\\nTo be consistent with other Speckle connectors you should name your project `ConnectorAPP_NAME`, set the Assembly name

It\\'ll look something like the code below:\\n\\n    public class ConnectorBindingsAECApp : ConnectorBindings\\n      {\\n        public override string GetActiveViewName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<MenuItem> GetCustomStreamMenuItems()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetDocumentId()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetDocumentLocation()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetFileName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override string GetHostAppName()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<string> GetObjectsInView()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<string> GetSelectedObjects()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<ISelectionFilter> GetSelectionFilters()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override List<StreamState> GetStreamsInFile()\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override Task<StreamState> ReceiveStream(StreamState state, ProgressViewModel progress)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override void SelectClientObjects(string args)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override Task SendStream(StreamState state, ProgressViewModel progress)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n    \\n        public override void WriteStreamsToFile(List<StreamState> streams)\\n        {\\n          throw new NotImplementedException();\\n        }\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n41  \\n42  \\n43  \\n44  \\n45  \\n46  \\n47  \\n48  \\n49  \\n50  \\n51  \\n52  \\n53  \\n54  \\n55  \\n56  \\n57  \\n58  \\n59  \\n60  \\n61  \\n62  \\n63  \\n64  \\n65  \\n66  \\n67  \\n68  \\n69  \\n70  \\n71  \\n72  \\n\\nAs you might have guessed, we now need to populate these methods with logic that calls the host app API to perform the various actions. You don\\'t have to implement each method as some might not be relevant for your host application, but make sure exceptions are handled gracefully.

We encourage everyone adding it (and enabling it) in their connectors. The more usage we see, the more resources the project will get and a Better Speckle will be possible.\\n\\nThe telemetry service (matomo) is already added as a reference in Core, so you will just need to:\\n\\n*   initialize it with a `Setup.Init()` with the name of your connector as input, [example (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/2a2ac0a6900e8833081b8cc851878b0decffa304/ConnectorGrasshopper/ConnectorGrasshopper/Loader.cs#L25)\\n    .\\n*   track the [main actions (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Core/Core/Logging/Tracker.cs#L20-L48)\\n     with `Tracker.TrackPageView`, [example (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/2a2ac0a6900e8833081b8cc851878b0decffa304/ConnectorGrasshopper/ConnectorGrasshopper/Ops/Operations.SendComponent.cs#L59)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#writing-the-converter)\\n Writing the Converter\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLast crucial bit for your connector to work properly is to create a converter.

This is because kits are swappable and having a direct reference would prevent this mechanism from working.\\n\\n### [#](#creating-the-converter-project)\\n Creating the Converter Project\\n\\nCreate a new C# project for the converter, we recommend using a class library with .NET Standard 2.0.\\n\\nTo be consistent with other Speckle converters you should name your project `ConverterAPP_NAME`, set the Assembly name to `Objects.Converter.APP_NAME` and the namespace to `Objects.Converter.APP_NAME` where `APP_NAME` is the name of your host application (eg Tekla, Etabs...).\\n\\nThen add references to the following NuGet packages:\\n\\n*   `Speckle.Objects`\\n*   Your host app API (preferably as NuGets)\\n\\n### [#](#adding-the-converter-logic)\\n Adding the Converter Logic\\n\\nNow create a new class named `ConverterAPP_NAME` and have it implement the `ISpeckleConverter` interface.

So if your converter is built as `Objects.Converter.Tekla.dll` , the method should return `new string[] { \"Tekla\"};`\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to add your `APP_NAME` to the [list of applications in Core (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/Applications.cs)\\n, we can certainly do so, just submit a PR.\\n\\n### [#](#the-context-document)\\n The Context Document\\n\\nThe `SetContextDocument` is used to _inject_ the Document from the connector and host app API to the converter ( it might have a different name in your case, or not even exist!), but in software as Revit or Rhino it\\'s fundamental to create new objects, start transactions, get units etc...\\n\\n### [#](#the-convert-methods)\\n The Convert methods\\n\\nThe most important methods in a converter are `ConvertToNative` and `ConvertToSpeckle`, and are what will take most of your time and API flexing skills.\\n\\nPlease have a look at how things are done in other converters, you will most likely end up having a switch statement with a list of functions that handle the various geometry and data types.\\n\\nThe logic of these routines can get quite complicated if you want to support nested elements or update previously received objects, and we recommend adding such functionalities later.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to properly set the units of your objects when sending to Speckle and to scale incoming geometry when receiving from Speckle.\\n\\nFor any questions feel free to write on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n!\\n\\n### [#](#new-objects)\\n New Objects\\n\\nIf the host app you\\'re targeting uses object types not currently defined in the Objects kit and you\\'d like to write conversions for them, we are happy to extend it!\\n\\nPlease get in touch on the forum before making a PR, then have a look at [how to write new objects](/dev/objects.html#writing-objects)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#loading-the-converter)\\n Loading the Converter\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt some point in your `ConnectorBindings` you\\'ll need to implement the `SendStream` and `ReceiveStream` methods. It\\'s within these that we will be invoking methods of the converter and then either send or receive data to/from Speckle.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThe connector **should never have a direct references** to the converter or kit. This is because kits are swappable and having a direct reference would prevent this mechanism from working.\\n\\nTo invoke the `ConvertToNative` and `ConvertToSpeckle` methods (and other methods / properties as well) of the converter, we first need to load it. To do so, you should use the `KitManager` in `Core` as follows:\\n\\n    var kit = KitManager.GetDefaultKit();\\n    var converter = kit.LoadConverter(APP_NAME);\\n    // then stuff like converter.ConvertToNative(obj);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\nThe converter, as you might have seen above should have implemented other handy methods such as `CanConvertToSpeckle`\\n\\nFor more information on how to implement the send/receive bindings, use our connectors\\' implementations as reference, and (for receive) see [Traversal docs](/dev/traversal.html)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#publishing-the-connector)\\n Publishing the Connector\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe currently don\\'t have mechanisms to publish third party connectors via Manager, but if you\\'d like to do so please write on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n and we\\'ll work out a solution!

As mentioned in [this page](/dev/kits)\\n, kits are made of:\\n\\n*   an object model\\n*   a set of converters\\n\\nA good example is the Objects kit, in our [speckle-sharp repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\n[#](#object-model)\\n Object Model\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAn Object Model is just a collection _data structures_. These are the types that the kit is supporting, and for which conversion routines need to be written so that you can send and receive from Speckle.\\n\\n### [#](#creating-an-object-model)\\n Creating an Object Model\\n\\nThere are a few general rules to keep in mind when writing these classes.\\n\\n#### [#](#_1-always-inherit-from-the-base-class)\\n 1. Always Inherit from the `Base` Class\\n\\nThis ensures serialisation and deserialisation happen through Speckle, with the default sane serialisation handling that we know we can support. Most importantly, it will enable type name handling and cross-kit legibility. For more on the `Base` class, head to the [Base Object](/dev/base)\\n section.\\n\\n#### [#](#_2-reference-loops-will-be-ignored)\\n 2. Reference Loops will be Ignored\\n\\nYou can always recreate them post deserialisation using a function flagged with the `[OnDeserialized]` attribute like so:\\n\\n      [OnDeserialized]\\n      internal void onDeserialized(StreamingContext context)\\n      {\\n        Edges.ForEach(e => e.Brep = this);\\n        Loops.ForEach(l => l.Brep = this);\\n        Trims.ForEach(t => t.Brep = this);\\n        Faces.ForEach(f => f.Brep = this);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n#### [#](#_3-keep-data-structures-lean)\\n 3. Keep Data Structures Lean\\n\\nYou should prefer typed arrays over lists of non-primitive values. For example, instead of a `List<Point>` for keeping track of mesh vertices, use a `List<double>`\\n\\n#### [#](#_4-always-include-a-parameterless-constructor)\\n 4. Always Include a Parameterless Constructor\\n\\nThis is for Newtonsoft serialisation / deserialisation. At worst, flag one constructor with the `[JsonConstructor]` attribute. Keep in mind this does indirect magic that can potentially trip you up - eg key names must match argument prop names.\\n\\n### [#](#example)\\n Example\\n\\nWith these rules in mind, creating your own classes by inheriting from `Base` is relatively straight forward. Additionally, there are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nFor a simple example, this is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n[#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n----------------------------\\n\\nConverters are the key to interoperability. They include the conversion routines for objects to and from the object model types. You create a new converter for each different application you want to support by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleConverter` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleConverter.cs)\\n. All your converters should live together in the same kit alongside your types. You can see how we\\'ve implemented converters in our default Objects kit [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n.\\n\\nConverters exist in the `MyKit.Converter` namespace and can either be broken up into smaller partial classes for each supported type (see the Revit Converter) or for each category (eg `ConverterX.Geometry` and `ConverterX.BuiltElements` as in the rest of our converters).\\n\\nThe converters must implement two key methods (plus a few others not described here):\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nThe specific conversion routines for each supported type are defined separately and called from these key methods. If the type is not supported, an error should be added to the converter\\'s `ConversionErrors` and a null object should be returned.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nAnd here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kit-interface)\\n Kit Interface\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got your object model and your conversion routines, you can officially put together your kit by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleKit` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleKit.cs)\\n and register your `Types` and `Converters`.\\n\\n    public interface ISpeckleKit\\n    {\\n      IEnumerable<Type> Types { get; }\\n    \\n      IEnumerable<string> Converters { get; }\\n    \\n      string Description { get; }\\n      string Name { get; }\\n      string Author { get; }\\n      string WebsiteOrEmail { get; }\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Tries to load a converter for a specific app.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"app\">Must be one of the Kits.Applications variables.</param>\\n      /// <returns>The converter for the specific app, or null.</returns>\\n      public ISpeckleConverter LoadConverter(string app);\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kitmanager)\\n KitManager\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe KitManager is a handy tool for loading up different kits.

This allows you, as a developer, to even use Speckle \"without Speckle\".\\n\\nWe currently have a couple of transports scaffolded:\\n\\n*   in memory\\n*   sqlite\\n*   disk\\n*   remote (speckle server)\\n*   mongodb (experimental)\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports are available on NuGet as `Speckle.Transports.*`.\\n\\nWhy are transports really cool? Imagine you want to write your own server, from scratch. To use it in all our connectors, the only thing you need to do is write a transport that uses your server\\'s api!\\n\\nAnother use case would be if you want to simultaneously send your data to a MySQL database. We currently do not support this, but using a custom built transport, you can send your data to it, at the same time as sending it to a Speckle server.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nWhere are all the transports?\\n\\n*   Required ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Core/Transports)\\n     (in-memory, sqlite)\\n*   Extraneous ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Transports)\\n     (Server, Disk, MongoDB)\\n\\nHere\\'s how the `ITransport` interface looks like.

To use the client, you\\'ll need access to a Speckle server. To authenticate the client, you\\'ll either need local accounts (added using [Manager](/user/manager)\\n), or you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    \\n    # initialise the client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    # authenticate the client with a token\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # if you\\'re in an environment without accounts, you can construct an Account object yourself\\n    # or authenticate with just a token\\n    # client.authenticate_with_token(\"YOUR_TOKEN\")\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nNow that you have an authenticated client, you can start interacting with the API. Let\\'s create a new stream and get that stream back.\\n\\n    # create a new stream. this returns the stream id\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # use that stream id to get the stream from the server\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nNext, we\\'ll need some data to send. Let\\'s extend `Base` to create a simple block to make it more interesting. All your custom objects should inherit from `Base` to ensure that serialization will work as expected.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point\\n    \\n    class Block(Base):\\n        length: float\\n        width: float\\n        height: float\\n        origin: Point = None\\n    \\n        def __init__(self, length=1.0, width=1.0, height=1.0, origin=Point(), **kwargs) -> None:\\n            super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n            # mark the origin as a detachable attribute\\n            self.add_detachable_attrs({\"origin\"})\\n    \\n            self.length = length\\n            self.width = width\\n            self.height = height\\n            self.origin = origin\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNow let\\'s send a block to the server! To do this, you\\'ll first need to send the object to the stream and get back the object id or hash. You can then use this to create a commit on the stream that references this object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    # here\\'s the data you want to send\\n    block = Block(length=2, height=4)\\n    \\n    # next create a server transport - this is the vehicle through which you will send and receive\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n    # this serialises the block and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=block, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # you can now create a commit on your stream with this object\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        stream_id=new_stream_id, \\n        object_id=hash, \\n        message=\"this is a block I made in speckle-py\",\\n        )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nTada! You should now have a commit on your stream containing your block. You\\'ll be able to see the commit on the stream page on the web. Receiving an object back is pretty similar to receiving it. You\\'ll generally be using the client to get a commit, then getting the hash to receive from the `referencedObject` attribute on that commit.\\n\\n    # this receives the object back from the transport.\\n    # the received data will be deserialised back into a `Block` \\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#short-hand-the-stream-wrapper)\\n Short Hand: The Stream Wrapper\\n\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to simply send and receive objects using the `SpeckleClient` and a `ServerTransport`. Since v2.2.6, you can use a handy helper to get a client and a transport from a stream URL - the `StreamWrapper`!\\n\\nThe `StreamWrapper` can parse any URL pointing to a stream, branch, commit, object, or globals. If you have a local account for the stream you provided, you can get an authenticated client and transport using the helper methods:\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.wrapper import StreamWrapper\\n    \\n    # provide any stream, branch, commit, object, or globals url\\n    wrapper = StreamWrapper(\"https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/commits/604bea8cc6\")\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated SpeckleClient if you have a local account for the server\\n    client = wrapper.get_client()\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated ServerTransport if you have a local account for the server\\n    transport = wrapper.get_transport()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#overview-of-functionality)\\n Overview of Functionality\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#graphql-client)\\n GraphQL Client\\n\\nThe `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API. You\\'ll need to have access to a speckle server to use this. To authenticate, you\\'ll need a token. You can either get one from an account you\\'ve already added to your computer using the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n, or you can head to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account, get_local_accounts\\n    \\n    all_accounts = get_local_accounts() # get back a list\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    \\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nInteracting with streams is designed to be intuitive and evocative of SpecklePy 1.0\\n\\n    # get a list of your most recent streams\\n    stream_list = client.stream.list()\\n    \\n    # search your streams\\n    results = client.stream.search(\"mech\")\\n    \\n    # create a stream\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # get a stream\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nNew in 2.0: branches and commits!

You will need to provide a `transport` to indicate where the objects should be sent to/received from. When sending, you can provide multiple transports to send the same object to multiple places simultaneously. Currently, we have three types of \\'transport\\': `SQLiteTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, and `ServerTransport`. If you\\'d like to learn more about Transports in Speckle 2.0, have a look [here](/dev/transports)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.memory import MemoryTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    transport = MemoryTransport()\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # this serialises the object and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=base_obj, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # if the object had detached objects, you can see these as well\\n    saved_objects = transport.objects # a dict with the obj hash as the key\\n    \\n    # this receives an object from the given transport, deserialises it,\\n    # and recomposes it into a base object.\\n    # you can optionally provide a local_transport which will default to\\n    # the `SQLiteTransport` pointing at your local cache\\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nYou can also use the GraphQL API to send and receive objects. However, note that this method will not recompose a base and will only get the object you explicitly ask for using by its id.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer\\n    \\n    # create a test base object\\n    test_base = Base()\\n    test_base.testing = \"a test base obj\"\\n    \\n    # run it through the serialiser\\n    s = BaseObjectSerializer()\\n    hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)\\n    \\n    # send it to the server\\n    objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id=\"stream id\", objects=[obj])\\n    \\n    received_base = client.object.get(\"stream id\", hash)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\n### [#](#base-object-and-serialization)\\n Base Object and Serialization\\n\\n#### [#](#the-base-object)\\n The Base Object\\n\\nThe `Base` class is the one you\\'re familiar with from the rest of the Speckle universe. It generally behaves the same way as it does in the other SDKs. For more info about the `Base` object, have a look [here](/dev/base)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # creating a base we will nest within a parent base\\n    detached_base = Base()\\n    detached_base.name = \"a detached base\"\\n    \\n    # creating our parent base object\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # attributes can be added using dot or dict notation\\n    base_obj.name = \"my base\"\\n    base_obj[\"colour\"] = \"lilac\"\\n    \\n    # other base objects can be nested within.\\n    # prepending the attribute name with `@` will detach the nested base when sending\\n    base_obj[\"@nested\"] = detached_base\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\nThe `Base` class has a few handy instance methods for identifying your object\\'s typed and dynamic attributes:\\n\\n*   `get_typed_member_names()` gets all of the names of the defined (typed) attributes of the object\\n*   `get_dynamic_member_names()` gets all of the names of the dynamic attributes of the object\\n*   `get_member_names()` gets a list of all the attributes on the object, dynamic or not\\n\\nEach `Base` object has an `id` (a unique hash) as it does in the other SDKs. This field is only populated if the `Base` has been previously serialized. If you _really_ need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.\\n\\n#### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nThe `Base` class can be subclassed to create your own custom objects. These are automatically added to a class-level registry, simply a dictionary with the type name as the key. The type is automatically populated by the `speckle_type` attribute but can be overwritten when writing your class.\\n\\nNote that all typed attributes of a class **must be initialized with a non-mutable default value** or a value that you will only change by reassignment.

We\\'ll be receiving geometry from a stream, updating the data, and using it to do some calculations and simple plots using Plotly and Dash.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\nWe will assume you have general knowledge of Python and Speckle. If anything trips you up, have a look back at the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n or the [Speckle Concepts](/user/concepts)\\n.\\n\\nIf you want to follow along with the code, the repo for this project can be found [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/izzylys/demo-specklepy)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#receive-objects-from-the-server)\\n Receive Objects from the Server\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'ve already been through the [Python examples](/dev/py-examples)\\n, you\\'ll already know how to receive objects from the server. As a refresher, you\\'ll need to create a `SpeckleClient` which serves as your entry point to the API. We then authenticate this client using a token from a local account. If you haven\\'t used the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n to add a local account, you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token to use here. We\\'ll then use this client to get the commit we\\'re interested in.\\n\\nIn this case, we\\'re going to be looking at this twisty building Alan generated in Grasshopper and send to Speckle using the [Grasshopper Connector](/user/grasshopper)\\n. It has 10 levels split into separate objects each containing fields for facades, columns, banisters, and floor slabs.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-gh-commit.4e610fcb.gif)\\n\\nThe snippet below shows how you would authenticate the client, get the commit we\\'re interested in, and use a server transport to receive the commit object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    \\n    # create and authenticate a client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # get the specified commit data\\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    # create an authenticated server transport from the client and receive the commit obj\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#update-existing-objects)\\n Update Existing Objects\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve received this building from Grasshopper, let\\'s make some modifications. The data has already been structured nicely into a list of `Base` objects each representing a level. Each level has attributes containing that level\\'s facade, columns, banister, and floor slab.\\n\\n    {\\n        \"id\":  \"idfcaf8b9e145241dsdfa915885d87cda2\",\\n        \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\n        \"data\": [\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                \"id\":  \"ide6acabd37e865ce87a5sdf444d733877\",\\\\\\n                \"speckle_type\": \"Base\",\\\\\\n                \"@facade\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@columns\": [ { ... }, ... ],\\\\\\n                \"@banister\": { ... },\\\\\\n                \"@floorSlab\": { ... }\\\\\\n            },\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\n                ...\\\\\\n            }\\\\\\n        ]\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n\\nLet\\'s say we want to do some estimated embodied carbon calculations. However, currently no material information has been added to the elements in the stream. We can add this ourselves and update the stream for the rest of the team.\\n\\n### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nTo do this, let\\'s create classes for each material and add these materials to a \"material\" attribute on each object within the stream. Obviously, this is a bit of an over the top example. It would be more efficient to just add a string attribute to each object that indicates the material, then look up the material properties from a database when running the calculations. However, I want to have some fun here and show you some of the cool things you can do with the `Base` class!\\n\\nLet\\'s start with defining our materials as `Base` subclasses. This ensures they\\'ll be serialised correctly and that they\\'ll be picked up by the `Base` type registry. We can then create a mapping for each element type name to the `speckle_type` of the corresponding material class. The `speckle_type` is prepopulated by the class and defaults to the class name.\\n\\n    # density (kg/m^3) and embodied carbon (kg CO^2/kg) estimates\\n    # from https://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/embodied-energy/\\n    class Concrete(Base):\\n        density: str = 2400\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.159\\n    \\n    \\n    class Glass(Base):\\n        density: str = 2500\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.85\\n    \\n    \\n    class Steel(Base):\\n        density: str = 7800\\n        embodied_carbon = 1.37\\n    \\n    \\n    MATERIALS_MAPPING = {\\n        \"@floorSlab\": \"Concrete\",\\n        \"@banister\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@facade\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@columns\": \"Steel\",\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nWe can now write a function that iterates through all the members of a level and adds a material if it exists in our mapping.\\n\\n    def add_materials_data(level: Base) -> Base:\\n        # first, get all the attribute names\\n        names = level.get_member_names()\\n        # then iterate through them to check if they exist in our mapping\\n        for name in names:\\n            if name not in MATERIALS_MAPPING.keys():\\n                break\\n            # if they do, use this class method to get the class and init it\\n            material = Base.get_registered_type(MATERIALS_MAPPING[name])()\\n            # now we can add a `@material` attribute dynamically to each object.\\n            # note that we\\'re making it detachable with the `@`\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                prop[\"@material\"] = material\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                for item in prop:\\n                    item[\"@material\"] = material\\n        return level\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNote that we\\'ve added a _detached_ dynamic attribute called `@material` to each element we are interested in. We\\'ve marked it as detachable (prepended with an `@`) so we don\\'t store hundreds of copies of the same materials classes in this stream. Each instance of each materials class in our case is the same, so we only need to store each once. However, we want to reference them within multiple elements. Using a detachable attribute is the solution! You get a reference for the correct material object in each element, but you only store unique objects (in our case, one instance of each material class) in the stream.\\n\\n### [#](#sending-to-the-stream)\\n Sending to the Stream\\n\\nWe can now use the `add_materials_data()` method we wrote to update all the levels in the stream and send these updated levels back. Let\\'s add on to what we\\'ve already written.\\n\\nTo send our updated building, we\\'ll need to create a parent `Base` and place our list of nested levels inside this parent. To keep things consistent, we\\'ll be adding them to a field called `data`.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nWe\\'ll then use `operations.send()` to send this object to the stream, then use `client.commit.create()` to commit our changes to the stream. If we want to send to a new branch, we can do so by first creating one using `client.branch.create(stream_id, name, description)`. The snippet below shows this full process.\\n\\n    # recap from earlier\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a branch if you\\'d like\\n    branch_name = \"🐍 demo\"\\n    branches = client.branch.list(STREAM_ID)\\n    has_res_branch = any(b.name == branch_name for b in branches)\\n    if not has_res_branch:\\n        client.branch.create(\\n            STREAM_ID, name=branch_name, description=\"new stuff from py\"\\n        )\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    # and send the data to the server and get back the hash of the object\\n    obj_id = operations.send(base, [transport])\\n    \\n    # now create a commit on that branch with your updated data!\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        STREAM_ID,\\n        obj_id,\\n        branch_name,\\n        message=\"add detached materials\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n\\nIf we go back to the web to look at the stream, you\\'ll see your newest commit. The geometry should look the same since this hasn\\'t been modified, but stepping into the data will show you the new material attribute. As you can see in the gif below, the id of the `Concrete` object is the same on different floor slabs since the attribute is detached and the objects are identical.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-materials-data.dee7f66f.gif)\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve sent your changes to the server, anyone you\\'re collaborating with will also be able to pull down your changes and use these updated elements with materials data!\\n\\n[#](#do-cool-stuff)\\n Do Cool Stuff\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve now seen how we can receive, work with, and send data from Python just like you can with any of the other SDKs and connectors. Great, now we can use that data to make something cool! Let\\'s plot the data using [plotly (opens new window)](https://plotly.com/python/)\\n and display it on a simple page using [dash (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n. I won\\'t go into too much detail on using the libraries themselves, but most of the plotting code has just been modified from the boilerplate and examples in their docs.\\n\\nTo start, let\\'s extract some existing data from the objects and plot them. Each geometry object we\\'re interested in has a `Vertices` attribute containing a list of points. Let\\'s plot the vertices of the floor slabs and columns on a 3D scatter plot. To do this, we\\'ll need to construct a pandas data frame with the values we are interested in by iterating through the levels.\\n\\n    import pandas as pd\\n    \\n    def construct_points_df(levels: List[Base]):\\n        # initialise a pandas data frame\\n        df_vertices = pd.DataFrame(columns=(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"element\"))\\n    \\n        vertices = []\\n        for level in levels:\\n            # add column vertices\\n            columns = level[\"@columns\"]\\n            for column in columns:\\n                points = column.Vertices\\n                for p in points:\\n                    vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"columns\"})\\n            # add floor slab vertices\\n            floorslab = level[\"@floorSlab\"]\\n            points = floorslab.Vertices\\n            for p in points:\\n                vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"floorSlab\"})\\n    \\n        return df_vertices.append(vertices)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nNow we can just pass that data frame into the plotly express `scatter_3d` method and `show()` the figure.\\n\\n    import plotly.express as px\\n    \\n    df_vertices = construct_points_df(levels)\\n    \\n    fig = px.scatter_3d(\\n        df_vertices,\\n        x=\"x\",\\n        y=\"y\",\\n        z=\"z\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        opacity=0.7,\\n        title=\"Element Vertices (m)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    fig.show()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\nPlotly plots have interactivity built in, so this is all the code we need to produce this 3D scatter plot.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VGcrHPB.gif)\\n\\nNext, let\\'s make use of the material properties we added to each of the stream objects. Let\\'s calculate the mass and embodied carbon for each element type in one level and construct a data frame with the results.\\n\\n    def construct_carbon_df(level: Base):\\n        data = {\"element\": [], \"volume\": [], \"mass\": [], \"embodied carbon\": []}\\n    \\n        # get the attributes on the level object\\n        names = level.get_dynamic_member_names()\\n        # iterate through and find the elements with a `volume` attribute\\n        for name in names:\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                if not hasattr(prop, \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                # if it has a volume, use the material attribute to calculated\\n                # the embodied carbon\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(prop.volume)\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                if not hasattr(prop[0], \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(sum(p.volume for p in prop))\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            data[\"element\"].append(name[1:]) # removing the prepending `@`\\n    \\n        return pd.DataFrame(data)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nUsing this data frame, we can use the plotly express `pie()` and `bar()` methods to create some lovely plots.\\n\\n    # take the first level from our levels list and construct a data frame\\n    df_carbon = construct_carbon_df(levels[0])\\n    \\n    # let\\'s add them all to a dict to keep the together\\n    figures = {}\\n    \\n    figures[\"volumes\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"volume\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Volumes of Elements Per Floor (m3)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon bar\"] = px.bar(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        x=\"element\",\\n        y=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon pie\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nThe last thing we\\'re going to do is add the figures to a dash app. To do this, we are simply taking the boilerplate [dash layout (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n, replacing the sample figure with our own figures, and adding some custom css in `/assets/style.css`.\\n\\n// Make sure to add code blocks to your code group\\n\\nNow all that\\'s left is to run `app.py` and head to [`http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (opens new window)](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)\\n to see your amazing plots.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\n[#](#conclusion)\\n Conclusion\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAnd voila - you\\'ve created the basis for a dashboard powered by your Speckle data!

The examples assume a Viewer instance named `v`.\\n\\n### [#](#load-unload-an-object)\\n Load/Unload an Object\\n\\n`v.loadObject( objectUrl )` / `v.unloadObject( objectUrl )`\\n\\nExample: `v.loadObject( 'https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/objects/e05c5834368931c9d9a4e2087b4da670' )`\\n\\n### [#](#get-properties-of-loaded-objects)\\n Get Properties of Loaded Objects\\n\\n`v.getObjectsProperties()`\\n\\nThis returns a dictionary with `{ propertyName: propertyInfo }` elements. The property information provided is:\\n\\n*   `type` ( == `'string'` / `'number'` / `'boolean'`): the property type\\n*   `objectCount` (int): How many objects in the scene have this property\\n*   `allValues` (array of `objectCount` elements): The values for this property of all objects that have this property\\n*   `minValue` - the smallest value (using `<` operator, works also on strings)\\n*   `maxValue` - the largest value\\n*   `uniqueValues` - a dictionary of `{ uniqueValue: occurrenceCount }` elements, specifying how many objects have the property set to that specific value\\n\\n### [#](#filtering-and-colouring)\\n Filtering and Colouring\\n\\nThose calls filter and color the objects loaded in the scene, and drops the previous applied filters (filtering is not additive).\\n\\nSyntax: `await v.applyFilter( { filterBy, colorBy, ghostOthers } )`\\n\\nThe 3 optional parameters are:\\n\\n*   `filterBy`: A dictionary that specify the filter. Elements are in the form `{ propertyName: propertyValueFilter }`. The propertyValueFilter can be one of:\\n    \\n    *   A specific value: (only objects with that property value pass the filter)\\n    *   An array of values: An object passes the filter if its value is in the array\\n    *   A range of values, specified by `{ 'gte': value1, 'lte': value2 }` (greater than or equal, lower than or equal)\\n    *   An exclusion list, specified by `{ 'not': excludedValuesArray }`\\n*   `colorBy`: A dictionary that makes all objects colored based on a property value. Two types of coloring are supported:\\n    \\n    *   Gradient (from a numeric property): `{ 'type': 'gradient', 'property': propertyName, 'minValue': propertyMinValue, 'maxValue': propertyMaxValue, 'gradientColors': [color1, color2] }`\\n    *   Category (for coloring each unique value differently): `{ 'type': 'category', 'property': propertyName, 'values': { value1: color1, value2: color2, ... }, 'default': colorForAnyOtherValue }`. The `values` and the `default` parameters are optional: Random colors are generated if they are omitted.\\n*   `ghostOthers`: A boolean (default `false`).

With just a few lines of code, you\\'ll be able to send, receive and leverage our API from Google Sheets, Docs etc.\\n\\nHere\\'s a few examples to get you started.\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nFirst of all we need to create a [Personal Access Token](/dev/tokens)\\n, make sure to select the scopes that you\\'ll need for running your queries and mutations. As always, treat this token as a password!\\n\\n[#](#writing-your-queries)\\n Writing your Queries\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo learn how to write queries check out our section on the [Server API](/dev/server-api)\\n, and use the GraphQL explorer to make sure your query or mutation works as expected.\\n\\nNext, since App Scripts doesn\\'t have a GraphQL library we need to transform them a bit to work with `UrlFetchApp`, it\\'s just a matter of setting the right payload and parameters.\\n\\nHere\\'s what a function that runs a query to get the currently logged user looks like, remember to replace `YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN`. You can extend its fields to get the streams, branches and commits as well:\\n\\n    function getMe() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `query User {\\n                          user{\\n                            id,\\n                            email,\\n                            name\\n                          }\\n                        }`,\\n        variables: null,\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n\\nTIP\\n\\nHow do you create a token, we hear you ask? Read the section on [personal access tokens](/dev/tokens.html)\\n!\\n\\nHere\\'s a function that runs a mutation to create a new stream:\\n\\n    function createStream() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `mutation streamCreate($myStream: StreamCreateInput!) { streamCreate(stream: $myStream) }`,\\n        variables: {\\n          myStream: {\\n            name: \"Sample Stream\",\\n            description: \"Created from Google Sheets!\",\\n          },\\n        },\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nThis is all!

You can then use this to trigger ci apps, automation workflows, and more! The world is your oyster. Let\\'s have a quick look at how to work with them.\\n\\n[#](#setting-up-a-stream-webhook)\\n Setting Up A Stream Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOn the sidebar of a stream, you\\'ll find a \"⚙ Settings\" button. Click this and head to the \"Webhooks\" tab to add webhooks to your stream.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126977638-67d2958c-12d2-40b2-aef3-da5a01451773.gif)\\n\\nThere are a few different fields to fill out when setting up a webhook:\\n\\n*   URL: The URL that will be sent `POST` requests when your webhook is triggered\\n*   Description: Optional identifying text (will be shown when viewing all your webhooks in a list)\\n*   Secret: An optional token that will help you verity that requests you receive are actually coming from the Speckle Server. Requests will be secured with an `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` which you can verify upon receiving.\\n*   Triggers: The events you want to trigger the webhook\\n*   Enabled: Toggle the webhook on and off\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126979041-ac01d1f7-e9d3-455c-ab4f-7154ab891a96.png)\\n\\nYou can of course also manage webhooks via the [GraphQL API](/dev/server-graphql-api)\\n using the `webhookCreate`, `webhookUpdate`, and `webhookDelete` mutations. There is a `webhooks` field on the `stream` schema which you can query to get the webhooks for a stream and the `history` of previous requests.\\n\\n[#](#receiving-the-webhook)\\n Receiving the Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen the condition defined in the webhook definition is met, a `POST` request will be made to the provided URL.\\n\\nThe POST request will contain 1 string parameter, called `payload`, that is the JSON representation of the webhook payload.\\n\\nImportant note on the JSON encoding\\n\\nThe way of passing the POST parameter is `application/json`, and the parameter is again encoded as JSON for compatibility with various frameworks that don\\'t handle nested json properties. So the actual POST request body might look something like:\\n\\n    {\"payload\":\"{\\\\\"streamId\\\\\":\\\\\"a35c7a8bdd\\\\\",\\\\\"userId\\\\\":\\\\\"bc4e472126\\\\\",\\\\\"activityMessage\\\\\":\\\\\"Stream metadata changed\\\\\", ...\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nTo ensure that only the configured Speckle Server will successfully call your publicly available webhook server, there is the `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` header that can be used to validate the authenticity of the call. It is the sha256 HMAC on the payload json string, using the shared secret configured on the webhook. Example python code to validate the signature:\\n\\n    import hmac\\n    # ...\\n    \\n    expected_signature = hmac.new(SHARED_SECRET.encode(), payload_json.encode(), \\'sha256\\').hexdigest()\\n    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, SIGNATURE_FROM_HEADER):\\n        print(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n        return\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nAnd javascript (node):\\n\\n    const * as crypto from \\'crypto\\'\\n    \\n    const secret = \\'YOUR_SECRET_HERE\\'\\n    const expectedSignature = crypto\\n        .createHmac(\\'sha256\\', secret)\\n        .update(request.body.payload)\\n        .digest(\\'hex\\')\\n    const signatureFromHeader = request.headers[\\'x-webhook-signature\\']\\n    \\n    if (signatureFromHeader != expectedSignature) response.status(401).send(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#reporting-success)\\n Reporting Success\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe endpoint code should return a HTTP response status header. The server recognises statuses `200 OK` to `204 NO_CONTENT` as a successful execution. Alternatively, your endpoint can respond with other statuses in its execution. The webhook execution log shows these as error with additional payload data you supply to diagnose issues.\\n\\nGo back to the main \"Webhooks\" tab to view all the webhooks on the stream. Click on a webhook to open the edit menu. The symbol to the left to the description indicates the status of the last webhook request; hover over it to get more information. Here, the green ✔ indicates the last request was successfully sent. The grey circle with an ❕ indicates no requests have been sent yet (you\\'ve likely just created the webhook and none of the triggers have happened yet). If the last request failed, you will see a red ❌ which you can hover over to see the error message.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126981792-d1a66613-43d9-4992-a8e2-fe692b68198e.png)\\n\\n[#](#avoid-looping)\\n Avoid Looping\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n**⚠️ Warning:** Any time you make a commit in response to a triggered stream webhook event, you are at risk of creating an infinite loop on both your handling code and your speckle server.

This has security implications too.\\n*   database backups: again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability. Cloud providers can provide horizontal VM auto-scaling and Kubernetes can provide horizontal pod auto-scaling but these are not discussed in this guide.\\n*   monitoring: this setup does not describe integrations for telemetry, metrics, tracing, or logging. Nor does it describe alerting or response actions.\\n*   firewall and network hardening: running in production requires additional security hardening measures, particularly protecting the network from intrusion or data exfiltration.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n*   \\\\[Required\\\\] A [DigitalOcean (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\\n     account.

We provided the cluster a name, but otherwise left configuration as per DigitalOcean\\'s recommended defaults. When prompted to select the node count and size, we selected four nodes. Each node has the default 2 vcpu and 4Gb (`s-2vcpu-4gb`). While this is a minimum, your usage may vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by deploying new nodes or larger sized machines in new node-pools. ![](/assets/img/01_select_node_size.07d7fdb8.png)\\n    \\n*   Configure other options for your Kubernetes cluster and click the `Create Cluster` button. After the cluster is created and initialized, you should see it in your list of kubernetes clusters: ![](/assets/img/02_kubernetes_clusters.21c632ca.png)\\n    \\n*   To log into the cluster, follow the getting started guide on the DigitalOcean dashboard for your cluster. We recommend the automated option of updating your local Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) using the [DigitalOcean client, `doctl` (opens new window)](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)\\n    . ![](/assets/img/03_get_kubeconfig.44d3076f.png)\\n    \\n*   After downloading the kubernetes config, you can verify that your kubernetes client has the cluster configuration by running the following command. A list of kubernetes clusters will be printed, your cluster context should have the prefix `do-`. Make a note of the name, you will use this in place of `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` in most of the following steps of this guide.\\n    \\n\\n    kubectl config get-contexts\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/04_show_contexts.5ec3c519.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl by running the following command to show the nodes you have provisioned.

Go to the [new Database creation page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new)\\n    . Firstly, select the same region and VPC as you used when deploying your Kubernetes cluster, and select Redis. Provide a name, and click `Create Database Cluster`.

You can provide your own if you have an existing blob storage which is compatible with the [Amazon S3 API (opens new window)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)\\n. Otherwise follow the following steps to create a new S3-compatible blob storage on DigitalOcean.\\n\\n*   Navigate to the [Create a Space page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/new)\\n    . Please select a region of your choice, we recommend the same region as you have deployed the cluster. We did not enable the CDN and we restricted the file listing for security purposes. Please provide a name for your Space, this has to be unique in the region so please use a different name than our example. Make a note of this name, this is the `bucket` value which we will require when configuring your deployment in [step 4](#step-4-configure-your-deployment)\\n    . Click on `Create Space`. ![](/assets/img/12_blob_storage_configuration.b77b8f17.png)\\n    \\n*   Once created, click on the `Settings` tab and copy the `Endpoint` value. ![](/assets/img/13_spaces_endpoint.1ed95325.png)\\n    \\n*   Now navigate to the [API page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)\\n     in DigitalOcean.

We can create a namespace in our Kubernetes cluster with the following command. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n\\n    kubectl create namespace speckle --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/15_create_namespace.a9e6faa4.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that the namespace was created by running the following command. You should see a list of namespaces, including `speckle`. The other existing namespaces were created by Kubernetes and are required for Kubernetes to run. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.\\n\\n    kubectl get namespace --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/16_get_namespaces.39b228b4.png)\\n\\n### [#](#step-3-b-create-secrets)\\n Step 3.b: Create Secrets\\n\\n*   To securely store the connection details of Speckle\\'s dependencies, we will create a secret in the Kubernetes Cluster in the `speckle` namespace. Replace all the items starting with `${YOUR_...}` with the appropriate value. `${YOUR_SECRET}` should be replaced with a value unique to this cluster, we recommend creating a random value of at least 10 characters long.\\n\\n    kubectl create secret generic server-vars \\\\\\n     --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\" \\\\\\n     --namespace speckle \\\\\\n     --from-literal=redis_url=\"${YOUR_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=postgres_url=\"${YOUR_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=s3_secret_key=\"${YOUR_SPACES_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=session_secret=\"${YOUR_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=email_password=\"${YOUR_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD}\" # optional, only required if you wish to enable email invitations\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n*   You can verify that your secret was created correctly by running the following command.

This guide provides details on how to do that.\\n*   If you want to deploy the Server with your own modifications, you should build your own docker images. Please refer to our separate guide on [local development](./server-local-dev)\\n    .\\n\\n[#](#dependencies)\\n Dependencies\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe Speckle server needs these services available over the network:\\n\\n*   PostgreSQL (tested with v12 and v13)\\n*   Redis\\n*   Optional: S3-compatible Object Storage\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nPostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO are included in the following deployment instructions, so **you don\\'t need to install them manually**.\\n\\nYou can also install them manually or use a managed deployment from a cloud provider (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc). Setting them up manually is out of scope of this article.\\n\\n[#](#run-in-a-virtual-machine)\\n Run in a Virtual Machine\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThis setup is not recommended for use in production for a few reasons, namely:\\n\\n*   application level updates: we tend to move quite fast, and if things get busy, blink twice and you’re on an outdated server. this has security implications too.\\n*   guaranteed uptime: from our experience, vm’s tend to restart now and then (they need updates and reboots too), which results in downtime.\\n*   database backups - again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   end-to-end encryption: possibly less of daily concern - we’re offering from encryption at rest, to https security (SSL/TLS certs & renewal) - so whenever data travels between a client and the db it’s always encrypted, inc. inside the datacenter itself.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\nThis is the easiest way to get the Server running.\\n\\nAs prerequisites, you only need a Linux VM with at least 4 GB of RAM and have [Docker (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)\\n and [Docker Compose (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)\\n installed.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-create-a-directory-for-this-deployment-on-the-system)\\n Step 1: Create a Directory for this Deployment on the System\\n\\n    mkdir /opt/speckle/\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#step-2-copy-and-paste-this-into-a-file-named-docker-compose-yml-in-your-directory)\\n Step 2: Copy and paste this into a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your directory\\n\\n    version: \"2.3\"\\n    name: \"speckle-server\"\\n    \\n    services:\\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server dependencies\\n      #######\\n      postgres:\\n        image: \"postgres:14.5-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          POSTGRES_DB: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_USER: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: speckle\\n        volumes:\\n          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/\\n        healthcheck:\\n          # the -U user has to match the POSTGRES_USER value\\n          test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready -U speckle\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      redis:\\n        image: \"redis:7-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - redis-data:/data\\n        ports:\\n          - \"127.0.0.1:6379:6379\"\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"--raw\", \"incr\", \"ping\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      minio:\\n        image: \"minio/minio\"\\n        command: server /data --console-address \":9001\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - minio-data:/data\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"mc\", \"ready\", \"local\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 5\\n    \\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server\\n      #######\\n      speckle-ingress:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-docker-compose-ingress:2\\n        restart: always\\n        ports:\\n          - \"0.0.0.0:80:8080\"\\n        environment:\\n          FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_MB: \"100\"\\n          NGINX_ENVSUBST_OUTPUT_DIR: \"/etc/nginx\"\\n    \\n      speckle-frontend-2:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-frontend-2:2\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME: \"local\"\\n          # TODO: Change NUXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN to the URL of the speckle server, as accessed from the network.

You can find instructions on how to do that [here](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n.\\n\\nTo update Speckle:\\n\\n1.  connect to the virtual machine running the Speckle server instance\\n2.  navigate to the folder, where the Speckle server docker-compose file is located\\n3.  run `docker compose down` (this will take the server offline)\\n4.  review the latest changes in this guide against your `docker-compose.yml` file, and amend as necessary.\\n5.  run `docker compose pull` (this will retrieve the latest images)\\n6.  run `docker compose up -d` (this starts the server stack, and runs it in the background)\\n\\nYour server instance should be back online and updated.\\n\\n[#](#run-your-speckle-server-fork)\\n Run Your Speckle-Server Fork\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you made some changes to the server and want to run those instead of the official releases, we created some useful docker-compose.yml files to help with that.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-set-up-dependencies)\\n Step 1: Set up Dependencies\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you set up PostgreSQL, Redis and S3-compatible service outside of this VM (for example a managed deployment from a cloud provider), you can skip this step, but remember to set up the correct environment variables later\\n\\nTo get the PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO dependencies up and running in the VM, our git repo contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-deps.yml)\\n for running these dependencies locally in docker containers.\\n\\nIt also includes `PGAdmin` and `redis-insight` to be able to explore the raw data. If you don\\'t need them, you can safely remove those entries from the `docker-compose-deps.yml` file.\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _PostgreSQL v13_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:5432` with default credentials `speckle`:`speckle` and a database named `speckle`.\\n*   _Redis v6_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:6379`\\n*   _PGAdmin4_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:16543` with default credentials `admin@localhost` : `admin`\\n*   _Redis Insight_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:8001`\\n*   _MinIO_, listening on `127.0.0.1:9000` with the API endpoint and on `127.0.0.1:9001` with the Web Management Interface (default credentials used: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)\\n\\nAll of the above containers listen on the local loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`) and are NOT accessible from the local network (for security, since they use default credentials)\\n\\nTo use PGAdmin, after login you can configure a server connection to the host `postgres` (user `speckle`, password `speckle`, database `speckle`)\\n\\nTo use Redis Insight, you can configure it to connect to the hostname `redis` (port `6379`)\\n\\nDocker Compose creates named docker volumes for storing data for each of the containers, so data is persisted. You can view existing docker volumes with `docker volume ls` and delete a volume and existing data with `docker volume rm [volume_name]`\\n\\n### [#](#step-2-build-and-run-your-code)\\n Step 2: Build and Run Your Code\\n\\nThe git repository contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-speckle.yml)\\n for building and running the Speckle server frontend and backend in docker containers.\\n\\nTo use it, first edit the variables in the `docker-compose-speckle.yml` file to reflect your environment. Then, you can start them with:\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-speckle.yml up --build -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\n(You can safely ignore the warnings about the _orphan containers_)\\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _docker-compose-ingress_, an nginx container that routes traffic to either speckle-frontend-2 or speckle-server as required. This is exposed on port 80 in the VM network.\\n*   _speckle-frontend-2_, the frontend Vue app. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _speckle-server_, the `server` component. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _preview-service_, the component that generates stream previews. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _webhook-service_, the component that calls webhooks. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _fileimport-service_, the component that imports uploaded files.

This is a high efficiency getting started step list.\\n\\n[#](#supported-platforms)\\n Supported Platforms\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle server has been developed on Linux, Windows WSL2, and MacOS. It _does not_ work on Windows without WSL2.\\n\\nOn MacOS devices with Apple based chips (M2, M3 etc.) it is possible to run the server as described below, but building and running Dockerfiles takes a lot of time (due to emulation of an x86 platform).\\n\\n### [#](#steps)\\n Steps\\n\\n1.  `git clone git@github.com:specklesystems/speckle-server.git` or, alternatively `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git`\\n2.  `cd speckle-server`\\n3.  `corepack enable`\\n4.  `yarn`\\n5.  `yarn build`\\n6.  `yarn dev:docker:up`\\n7.  `cp packages/server/.env-example packages/server/.env`\\n8.  `cp packages/server/.env.test-example packages/server/.env.test`\\n9.  `cp packages/frontend-2/.env.example packages/frontend-2/.env`\\n10.  `cp packages/dui3/.env.example packages/dui3/.env`\\n11.  `yarn dev`\\n\\nWait for the frontend to build, and voila, you have a fully functional Speckle Server running at [http://localhost:3000 (opens new window)](http://localhost:3000)\\n.\\n\\nTo run a specific part of the Speckle server stack, go to the [components](#components)\\n section\\n\\n[#](#details)\\n Details\\n----------------------\\n\\nLet's step back and see what we did.\\n\\n1.  To clone the repo git with [ssh key (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\\n     auth was used. You can use https based auth too, and can also gather some bonus points by using the `gh-cli` 😄\\n2.  We change into the cloned repository directory.\\n3.  Nodejs versions ^16 now come with a package manager manager bundled named `corepack`. It enables us to use yarn without actually installing anything.\\n4.  The monorepo is managed by [yarn workspaces (opens new window)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)\\n    . This way the package manager handles dependencies of the monorepo and the proper connections between the different packages. Running `yarn` a shorthand for `yarn install` bootstraps the repo.\\n5.  Some of the local packages (viewer, object loader) has to be built the first time so that all packages are linked properly. This can be done easily with a yarn script, where the yarn command will execute the given build script in all packages where it exists. So running `yarn build` triggers all available build commands.\\n6.  In this step, all the required services are started via docker compose. The `docker-compose-deps.yml` file contains a sensible default setup of all the required non Speckle developed services. This config by no means meant to be used in production. If you are not running these dependencies via docker compose, please make sure, that their configuration options are in line with either the compose file or the individual package configurations.\\n7.  In this step the provided example file is copied to a `.env` file with keeping the default values. Here again we are providing a set of sensible defaults that work out of the box if you follow this guide, but do make sure to reflect any changes you make in you environment.\\n8.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied when running tests or running the server in test mode\\n9.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to the new frontend\\n10.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to dui3\\n11.  Just like above, we use yarn to run the `dev` script in each package. This is probably not the most efficient way, since it starts more packages in development mode, than needed, but its the easiest command that gets a server up and running. When developing, you probably want to run each component separately. A good enough setup might be to just run the server and the preferred frontend (run `yarn dev` only in those individual package directories).\\n\\nWhen running `yarn dev` for all packages you might see errors relating to `@speckle/shared` being missing, but this is only temporarily because `@speckle/shared` is also being re-built at that point in time. Once its finished building all of the other packages should pick up on it and work fine. You might also see GraphQL Codegen errors, which also are temporary, because they rely on the speckle server being up and running.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon't forget to set up the variables in the `.env` & `.env.test` files according to your deployment\\n\\n[#](#components)\\n Components\\n----------------------------\\n\\nTo run a barebones Speckle Server, you need to run:\\n\\n*   the `frontend-2` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/frontend-2)\\n    )\\n*   the `server` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/server)\\n    )\\n\\nOptionally, to enable extra functionality, microservices should be run separately. For more information, check their `README.md` file in the git repository:\\n\\n*   the `preview-service` package generates preview images for streams (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/preview-service)\\n    )\\n*   the `webhook-service` package is responsible with calling the configured webhooks\\n*   the `fileimport-service` package parses and imports uploaded files into Speckle.\\n\\nDetailed instructions for running them locally are kept up to date in their respective `readme.md` files.\\n\\nIn this deployment type, the frontend Vue app will listen by default on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 8080`, but will have no knowledge about the `server` component, and thus **should not be accessed directly**.\\n\\nThe server component will listen on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 3000`, and will proxy the frontend requests to the frontend component (as configured in .env file).\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/server-local-dev.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/8/2024, 8:34:04 AM\\n\\n← [Deploying a Server - Docker Compose](/dev/server-manualsetup.html) [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)\",\n",

If installed with Speckle\\'s manual installation, by default the value of these are all `speckle`.\\n5.  (optional) For some databases, but not the default database provided by Speckle, you may also have to provide a Certificate.\\n    \\n    1.  Copy this certificate into the pgadmin container with `docker cp ./local/path/to/my/certificate.crt speckle-server-pgadmin-1:/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/` (assuming the default pgadmin user is `admin@localhost.com` and `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` is the name of the pgAdmin container.)\\n    2.

Expand `docker-compose` and `databases` to select your database. The default database name for Speckle is `speckle`.\\n    \\n2.  Once you have found the database in pgAdmin, right-click the database name and select `backup`.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/04_pgadmin_backup.47b980b4.png)\\n    \\n3.

This will generate a backup that is stored in the container\\'s volume.\\n    \\n6.  Once the backup is prepared, we now need to save the file to your local machine.\\n    \\n    *   If a `Click to open file location` button is displayed (this may depend on the version of pgAdmin running), click on it and download the backup to your machine.\\n        \\n    *   If a button is not displayed, you can copy the file from the container to your machine by user docker. Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n        \\n            docker cp speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/BACKUP_FILE_NAME\\' .\\n            \\n        \\n        1  \\n        \\n    *   If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake further steps to move the file from the host machine to either your local machine or storage location of your choice. DigitalOcean [suggest using `scp` (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-copy-files-from-one-server-to-another-droplet)\\n        .\\n        \\n7.  We recommend testing the integrity of the backup at this time. One way of doing this is to install speckle-server on another machine (or modify the name and ports in the file and install a second locally), then upload the backup per the below instructions using pgAdmin. Use pgAdmin or Speckle to check that the information is present.\\n    \\n8.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\n### [#](#backing-up-a-docker-volume-optional)\\n Backing up a Docker Volume (Optional)\\n\\nAs well as creating a Postgres backup, we also recommend a full Docker volume backup. The Docker volume backup can only be used with the current version of Postgres, so is more limited than the Postgres backup created via pgAdmin (the latter allows us to move data between different versions of Postgres, which is useful when upgrading). Generating an additional backup from the Docker volume provides us with additional confidence that we can recover to a previous good working state.\\n\\n1.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  Follow the instructions on backing up a Docker Volume in [Docker\\'s Documentation (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)\\n    \\n3.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\nIf you are not upgrading the Postgres database, you can stop at this step. The following instructions relate only to the event of a major version upgrade of Postgres.\\n\\n### [#](#preparing-postgres-for-an-upgrade)\\n Preparing Postgres for an upgrade\\n\\n1.  Determine the name of the Docker container that is running your Postgres database, and the version of Postgres.\\n    \\n        docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  If successful, the above will print out something similar to the below. In our example the name is `speckle-server-postgres-1` and the image version `13-alpine`.\\n    \\n        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                      NAMES\\n        510e024a4700   postgres:13-alpine   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp   speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    2  \\n    \\n3.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step will cause Speckle, and any other application relying on the database, to stop working until the database is restored. You may wish to notify users of your Speckle server about the disruption to Speckle before proceeding with this and the following steps. Stop your Postgres database with the following command, replacing `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker stop speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Remove the container from docker, this detaches it from its volume and allows the volume to be deleted. Replace `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker rm speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  During upgrades we recommend undertaking a Docker volume backup. This allows us to restore to the previous version if the upgrade was unsuccessful. See the instructions for undertaking a Docker volume backup in the section above.\\n    \\n7.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step is destructive and cannot be undone, please ensure that the backup is correct and saved securely before proceeding - see instructions above. Delete the volume storing your Postgres database, replacing `speckle-server_postgres-data` with the name of your Postgres volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume rm speckle-server_postgres-data\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n#### [#](#upgrading-postgres)\\n Upgrading Postgres\\n\\n1.  If you installed Postgres using Docker Compose, please log into the machine in which you installed it.\\n    \\n2.  Using `git`, clone the Speckle Server repository. More details instructions are available in GitHub\\'s documentation.\\n    \\n        git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.\\n    \\n        cd speckle-server\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Check out the version of Speckle Server you wish to deploy. For example, using `git` on the command line to checkout a tagged version - in this case Speckle Server version `2.9.0` (please change to the [latest released version (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/releases)\\n    , or the version you wish to deploy):\\n    \\n        git checkout tags/2.9.0 -b main\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Deploy the docker-compose file with the updated Postgres version:\\n    \\n        docker compose -f ./docker-compose-deps.yml up --detach\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  Verify everything is up and running by viewing the status of all containers:\\n    \\n        docker ps\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n### [#](#restoring-your-data-to-postgres-from-pgadmin-backup)\\n Restoring your Data to Postgres from pgAdmin Backup\\n\\n1.  If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake steps to move the file your local machine or storage location to the host machine (Droplet).

Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n    \\n        docker cp BACKUP_FILE_NAME speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Connect to pgAdmin using the instructions above.\\n    \\n4.  Connect pgAdmin to the server using the instructions above.\\n    \\n5.  Right-click `databases` from the browser window, and click `create`. The name of the database should be `speckle`.\\n    \\n6.  Right-click the created database and click `restore`, selecting your previously stored backup. You will need to upload the backup you previously downloaded back into pgAdmin first.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/06_pgadmin_restore.85bf2552.png)\\n    \\n7.  If you encounter errors at this point, it may be because pgAdmin considers the database to be a `maintenance database`. To workaround this issue please try the following:\\n    \\n    1.  Create another (maybe empty) database.\\n    2.  Disconnect from the Speckle database.\\n    3.  Edit server properties for other database.\\n    4.

They function like ordinary OAuth access tokens, and they enable a script, an app, or any other piece of code to **act on your behalf**.\\n\\nThis means that with a token, an app or script is able to:\\n\\n*   read any streams you have access to\\n*   create streams on your behalf\\n*   share those streams with other users\\n*   create commits against a stream you have write access to\\n*   read the profile (public information) of other users.\\n\\nSecurity advisory\\n\\nTreat any personal access tokens like a password: do not post them anywhere where they could be accessed by others (e.g., public repos).\\n\\n[#](#creating-a-token)\\n Creating a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, you need to login and go to your profile (/profile). Just under \"Your Apps\" section, you will see a list of all the personal access tokens that you have created so far, and you\\'ll be able to create a new one.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens1.dfd285b0.png)\\n\\nTo create a new token, click on the new token button. A dialog will appear that will ask you for some basic details about it.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens2.ad8a0c88.png)\\n\\nThe token name should be something that you can remember. The token scopes define what actions can be taken with that specific token.\\n\\nToken Scopes\\n\\nIt\\'s good practice to limit the scopes to minimum required ones. For example, if you\\'re creating a script or app that just **reads** from streams, and doesn\\'t need to create new ones, or edit existing ones, just assign it the `streams:read` scope.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens3.09032568.png)\\n\\nOnce your token is created, the dialog will display it. This is the first and last time you will be able to see the full token and you should store it somewhere safe now.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens4.2dbb6491.png)\\n\\n[#](#using-a-token)\\n Using a Token\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you have a token, you usually will need to pass it as an authorization header in any server bound requests.\\n\\nFor example, here is a simple request to get the total count of your streams using javascript:\\n\\n    let res = await fetch(\\'/graphql\\', {\\n      method: \\'POST\\',\\n      headers: {\\n        Authorization: \\'Bearer \\' + token, // <- Passing in the token!\\n        \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'\\n      },\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ user { id streams { totalCount } } }` })\\n    })\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n\\nNote that the token needs to be prefixed with the word `Bearer`; a full token would look like `Bearer xxx`.\\n\\n[#](#revoking-a-token)\\n Revoking a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'re no longer using a token, or you think it may be compromised (did you commit it by accident to a public github repo?), you can revoke a token. It will be completely disabled and no more actions will be able to be taken with it.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nAs soon as possible afterwards, make sure any scripts or apps using that token did not break!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/tokens.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 9/6/2022, 12:01:02 PM\\n\\n← [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html) [Creating Your Own App](/dev/apps.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

It\\'s geared towards an audience that is familiar with Javascript and web development, or at least not scared by it!\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ll be creating a very simple web app capable of:\\n\\n*   Authenticating a user through a Speckle server OAuth.\\n*   Search for stream\\'s available to the user.\\n*   Display commit data associated with a given stream.\\n*   Filter the data to be displayed.\\n*   Cache results in `localStorage` to _remember_ the app state across page reloads.\\n\\nLet\\'s get started! 🚀\\n\\nFollowing along\\n\\nIf too busy to follow all the steps, you can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-demo-app)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#requirements)\\n Requirements\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guide should work in any platform (Mac/Linux/Windows). We\\'ll be using _VSCode_ as our IDE but you can use any other (even Notepad if your brave enough!).\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need to have Node installed, as well as `vue-cli` and have some basic understanding of how Vue works.\\n\\nInstalling the prerequisites\\n\\n**Node:** Probably the easiest way to manage your node installation is through `nvm`. On Windows, you can [use this guide (opens new window)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#install-nvm-windows)\\n. If on OSX, you can use the [original nvm (opens new window)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)\\n.\\n\\n**Vue CLI**: Once you have node installed, it\\'s just a matter of running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.\\n\\nGetting familiar with Vue\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t used Vue before, don\\'t worry. It\\'s quite easy to get started with it - here\\'s [some docs (opens new window)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)\\n you could run through beforehand.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also be using some of Vue\\'s most popular plugins: `vuex` and `vue-router`. If you\\'re unfamiliar with them, they have great quick-start guides on their site!\\n\\n*   [`vuex`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n*   [`vue-router`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#setting-up-the-vue-app)\\n Setting up the Vue app\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the simplest step. Open a new terminal, set the current directory to wherever you want the project to be located and run the following command:\\n\\n    vue create speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nThis will ask you some questions, such as the version of vue to use, what plugins to install, etc. **It is important that you answer the questions correctly**, otherwise, your project may be missing some key features.\\n\\nVue setup - Step by step\\n\\n1.  When prompted for a preset, select **Manually select features** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step1.dcfa5f44.png)\\n2.  Next, specify the features needed for this project:\\n    *   Choose vue version\\n    *   Babel\\n    *   PWA\\n    *   Router\\n    *   Vuex\\n    *   CSS Pre-processors\\n    *   Linter ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step2.05778446.png)\\n3.  Choose version **2.x** of Vue.js ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step3.4097c34f.png)\\n4.  Choose **Yes** when prompted to use **history mode for router** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step4.ec673eac.png)\\n5.  For the css-preprocessor to use, select **Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step5.c8848709.png)\\n6.  When prompted for a Linter, choose the option **ESLint with error prevention only** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step6.fc39a92e.png)\\n7.  When prompted for additional lint features, select **Lint on save** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step7.d4eddbd5.png)\\n8.  Choose to place config files **In dedicated config files** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step8.cfe4baaf.png)\\n9.  At last, you can save this selection as a preset, but for this time just select **No** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step9.b8f89232.png)\\n10.  Wait for the process to finish ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step10.4d92a129.png) \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with this process, just select the same answers as the screenshot bellow:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup.55edbdef.png)\\n\\nOnce done, you\\'d have your Vue project ready. To open the project in **VSCode** we just need to run:\\n\\n    code speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nThis step assumes you already installed VSCode in your path. If you haven\\'t, there\\'s a command for it in VSCode.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vscode-shell-install.df19f814.png)\\n\\n### [#](#install-other-dependencies)\\n Install other dependencies\\n\\nFor our UI, we\\'ll also be using [Vuetify](TODO)\\n to make our life easier, as it has many useful components. To add it, run:\\n\\n    vue add vuetify\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWhen asked for a preset, choose **Default**.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also need to add a couple of handy dependencies such as `vuex-persist` for state storage, `vue2-timeago` to display user-friendly dates and `debounce`. For this, run the following command:\\n\\n    npm i vuex-persist vue2-timeago debounce\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#run-your-app-for-the-first-time)\\n Run your app for the first time\\n\\nIf everything went well, running the following command should make the app available at [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](http://localhost:8080)\\n.\\n\\n    npm run serve\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIn chrome, things should be looking like this:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-setup-preview.a007a970.png)\\n\\n[#](#authenticating-with-the-server)\\n Authenticating with the Server\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#creating-the-speckle-files)\\n Creating the `Speckle` files\\n\\nFor convenience, we\\'re going to isolate all the `speckle` related code into 2 files:\\n\\n*   `src/speckleQueries.js` will hold some utility functions to build our `GraphQL` queries.\\n*   `src/speckleUtils.js` will hold all call\\'s to the Speckle server, as well as some constants. It will deal with login/logout functionality too.\\n\\n### [#](#registering-an-application-on-the-speckle-server)\\n Registering an Application on the Speckle Server\\n\\nIn order to be able to talk to our Speckle server, we first need to `Create an App` in that server with an existing account. To do that, visit the server\\'s frontend [https://app.speckle.systems (opens new window)](https://app.speckle.systems)\\n, log in with your account and visit the profile page.\\n\\nScroll down until you see the `Applications` section, and press the `New App` button. A pop-up should appear, fill it in as follows:\\n\\n*   **Name:** SpeckleDemoApp\\n*   **Scopes**: `stream:read`, `profile:read`, `profile:email`\\n*   **Redirect url**: `http://localhost:8080`\\n*   **Description**: My first speckle app\\n\\nOnce accepted, you\\'ll see the `App Id` and `App Secret`, as well as an indication to the url pattern we should use (`https://app.speckle.systems/authn/verify/{appId}/{challenge}`).\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nNote that the `redirect url` points to our local computer network. When deploying this app to a service like Netlify, we\\'ll have to create a new one pointing to the correct Netlify url.\\n\\n#### [#](#saving-app-credentials-as-env-variables)\\n Saving app credentials as ENV variables\\n\\nThe `App Id` and `App Secret` are used to identify your app, so you should never add them to your version control. Instead, we\\'ll be using `ENV` variables to save that information, which also allows us to modify it in different scenarios (development/production).\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor those of you who wonder, frontend applications that integrate with the Speckle Server are treated as OAuth **public applications**, because they cannot keep their id and secret safe.\\n\\nVue will automatically read any `.env` files in the root of your project and load the variables accordingly, but will also replace all references with the actual value of the variable on compilation (which we **do not want**). We can tell `vue.js` to not do this by creating a file named `.env.local` instead. The contents should look like this 👇🏼 (remember to replace your ID and Secret appropriately).\\n\\n    # The Speckle Application Id\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_ID=YOUR_APP_ID \\n    \\n    # The Speckle Application Secret\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET\\n    \\n    VUE_APP_SERVER_URL=https://app.speckle.systems\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME=\"Speckle Demo App\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n### [#](#login-in-with-speckle)\\n Login in with Speckle\\n\\nA simplified version of the auth flow with a Speckle Server can be summarised as follows:\\n\\n1.  User clicks the Login button\\n2.  User is redirected to the auth page in the Speckle server (using the provided url pattern when creating an application)\\n3.  User will log in and allow the app to access their data (hopefully?).\\n4.  User is redirected to our specified `Redirect URL`, with an attached `access_code`.\\n5.  Using that access code, we can exchange it for a pair of `token/refresh token`, which is what allows the app to \"talk\" to the server as that user. We\\'ll save those in `localStorage`.\\n\\nThis may sound rather complicated, but it boils down to 2 different interactions (redirect your user and exchange the access code).\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-auth-functions-to-speckleutils-js)\\n Adding auth functions to `speckleUtils.js`\\n\\nIn our `src/speckleUtils.js` file, paste in the following code. You\\'ll find some constants that refer to our previously set `ENV` variables, as well as several functions.\\n\\n*   `goToSpeckleAuthPage`: Will generate a random challenge, save it in localStorage and direct the url to the auth page in the specified speckle server.\\n*   `exchangeAccessCode`: Will `fetch` from the server a new pair of `token/refresh token` and clear the `challenge`.\\n*   `speckleLogOut`: Will erase all necessary data from `localStorage`.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nNote that `goToSpeckleAuthPage` saves the challenge, and `exchangeAccessCode` uses that same challenge to exchange the tokens.

The first one will take you to the stream page in the server, while the second one will clear the selection in the app state.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-stream-search.641f64ce.gif)\\n\\n[#](#displaying-stream-commits)\\n Displaying stream commits\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo far, we\\'ve managed to authenticate with our Speckle server, fetch user and server information and search for available streams, as well as storing the results in our app state.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use our `selectedStream` to display a table with all it\\'s commits, as well as some data associated with each commit. Since the commit list can be rather large, we\\'ll be adding basic pagination functionality to the table.\\n\\nFor that, we\\'ll need to fetch the commit data associated with the stream, modify our `store/index.js` to hold that new data, and add a table view with a column filter on `Home.vue`\\n\\n### [#](#create-fetch-query)\\n Create fetch query\\n\\nLet\\'s start by adding a new query function to our `speckleQueries.js`\\n\\n    export const streamCommitsQuery = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) => `query {\\n        stream(id: \"${streamId}\"){\\n          commits(limit: ${itemsPerPage}, cursor: ${\\n      cursor ? \\'\"\\' + cursor + \\'\"\\' : null\\n    }) {\\n            totalCount\\n            cursor\\n            items{\\n              id\\n              message\\n              branchName\\n              sourceApplication\\n              referencedObject\\n              authorName\\n              createdAt\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }`\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nAnd add the following to `speckleUtils.js` (remember to import the `streamCommitsQuery`)\\n\\n    export const getStreamCommits = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) =>\\n      speckleFetch(streamCommitsQuery(streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor))\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nNotice that the query has a `cursor`. This is used to get successive _pages_ of the commits list. There is a current limitation with the cursor, as it only allows to go _forward_ in pages, not backward. To fix this, we\\'ll keep track of these values in our store so we can have pagination going forward (we\\'ll also keep the `itemsPerPage` value fixed to keep things simple).\\n\\n[#](#update-store-index-js)\\n Update `store/index.js`\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, there\\'s quite a bit of modifications in the `store/index.js` file. I\\'ve highlighted the changes in the code block, but feel free to replace the whole content for the one bellow.\\n\\nWe basically need modify the state to be able to:\\n\\n*   Store the `latestCommits` data, a list of `previousCursors` and a list of `tableOptions` for the table visualization.\\n*   Add mutations to modify individually each of these state properties (note that `previousCursors` is a list, so we added two mutations: one to push a new value and another to replace the entire list)\\n*   Add `getCommits` action, and update `logout`, `handleStreamSelection` and

highlighted the changes in the code block, but just as the step below, feel free to replace the entire content if you\\'re playing it fast and loose!\\n\\nWe need to do the following modifications:\\n\\n*   Add a new `div` for the table view containing a `v-select` and a `v-data-table`.\\n    *   The `v-select` allows to select the available keys to display as table columns\\n    *   The `v-data-table` does all the table UI magic so we don\\'t have to.\\n*   Add several computed properties:\\n    *   `commits` and `previousCursors` to fetch the data from our store\\n    *   `availableKeys` and `filteredHeaders` are helper functions to extract all available keys from the received commit data and format the headers the way `v-data-table` likes them.\\n*   Add new data properties to the component:\\n    *   `options` will serve to keep the table options in sync\\n    *   `selectedKeys` is where we\\'ll save the user selected information to display as columns in the

Go ahead to [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](https://localhost:8080)\\n. If logged in, your app should be looking like this 👇🏼\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-full-demo.1024d106.gif)\\n\\n[#](#adding-data-persistence)\\n Adding data persistence\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur app seems to be working fine, but there\\'s still a small adjustment that we can do to make things better. If, for any reason, a user reloads the page, they will loose their current stream selection + commit results, which is annoying. Let\\'s fix that!\\n\\nThankfully, we only need to modify the `store/index.js` file slightly to make this happen. We already installed `vuex-persist`, the plugin that will do all the heavy lifting for us.\\n\\nFirst, import vuex-persist:\\n\\n    import VuexPersistence from \"vuex-persist\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nthen create an instance (you\\'ll need to import `APP_NAME` from `speckleUtils.js`) that uses `localStorage`. We could also use `sessionStorage`, which would be deleted at the end of the session.\\n\\n    const vuexLocal = new VuexPersistence({\\n      storage: window.localStorage,\\n      key: `${APP_NAME}.vuex`\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nadd a `plugins` property to the `Vuex.Store` constructor config:\\n\\n    export default new Vuex.Store({\\n      plugins: [vuexLocal.plugin],\\n      ...\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nand that\\'s it! Your app should now persist the app state across page refresh. 🚀\\n\\n[#](#publish-to-netlify)\\n Publish to Netlify\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we have our app up and running locally, there\\'s just one last thing to do: deploy it!\\n\\nWe\\'ll be using Netlify for this guide, but you could also as easily use Heroku, or any other platforms that supports web-app s like Vue.js out of the box.\\n\\nFirst, you\\'ll need a GitHub account to push your app\\'s repo to, and a Netlify account. If you haven\\'t got a netlify account yet, you can log in with your GitHub account, which will make your life easier.\\n\\n### [#](#create-your-site)\\n Create your site\\n\\n1.  Go to your Netlify\\'s dashboard and find the `New site from Git` button ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site.88cb7d26.png)\\n2.  Follow the steps as shown:\\n    1.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-2.1f6bdff9.png)\\n    2.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-3.d288f521.png)\\n    3.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-4.ca2b8d4b.png)\\n    4.  Once this is done, you\\'ll have a netlify url where you\\'re app will live.\\n3.  Create a new Application on the Speckle server and set it\\'s callback url to the application url you just got from Netlify. This will give you a new `appId` and `appSecret`.\\n4.  Last step is to set the `env` variables, similar to how we did it for our development server.\\n    1.  Go to `Site Settings`\\\\->`Build and Deploy`\\\\-`Environment`\\n    2.  Add the same environment variables as in your `.env.local` file but using the `appId` and `appSecret` values from step 3. ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-env.167695cc.png)\\n5.  Go to the `Deploys` section of your app, find the `Trigger Deploy` button and select the `Deploy Site` option. This will force your app to restart and detect the new env variables.\\n\\nThat\\'s it! If you visit your netlify url, you should see your app running smoothly!\\n\\n[#](#wrapping-it-up)\\n Wrapping it up\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve covered quite a lot on this guide, but this was only a small example of interacting with Speckle streams and commits. Expanding on this further can move onto using the Speckle Viewer, fetch the data inside commits, receive notifications from the server, and more!\\n\\nCode Repository\\n\\nYou can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository.

We have all the tools ready for you to start developing your own!\\n\\nWe are very enthusiastic about community connectors and would love to help you bring them to life. To get started, check out the guide below. Feel free to reach out with any questions or calls for more contributors to the project on our [forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#before-you-begin)\\n Before you Begin\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore you begin writing your own connector, we encourage you to follow the steps below:\\n\\n1.  **make sure you are comfortable** writing plugins for the host application you are planning to target, otherwise the guide below will not be of great help 😅\\n2.  **post on the [community forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/)\\n    ** announcing what you are planning to develop and how\\n3.  **consider** that if you make your connector publicly available, it\\'s going to be your own responsibility to maintain it\\n4.  **check whether the [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n     kit is fit** to support your future connector, if it might need to be extended or if you might want to develop a new kit as well\\n5.  **read** our [dev docs on Base object, kits, transports](/dev/base.html)\\n     etc...\\n\\n[#](#anatomy-of-a-connector)\\n Anatomy of a Connector\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nConnectors are made of the following parts:\\n\\n*   **a User Interface**\\n*   **bindings** between the host application and the UI\\n*   **custom logic** specific to the host application (for selecting elements, saving senders and receivers in the project file etc)\\n*   **a converter** to convert between the host application and Speckle geometry and BIM elements\\n\\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we\\'ll be using a user interface called [DesktopUI](/user/ui)\\n currently in use by our Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD and Civil 3D connectors. But you can of course create your own or use whatever the host application you are integrating with provides - that\\'s the case of visual programming software.\\n\\n[#](#getting-started)\\n Getting Started\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nTo get started, create a C# project in your IDE of choice by following the conventions and requirements for writing plugins for the host application you are targeting. In most cases you\\'ll be creating a .NET Framework class library project.\\n\\nTo be consistent with other Speckle connectors you should name your project `ConnectorAPP_NAME`, set the Assembly name to `SpeckleConnectorAPP_NAME` and the namespace to `Speckle.ConnectorAPP_NAME` where `APP_NAME` is the name of your host application (eg Tekla, Etabs...).\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nThe minimum supported .NET Framework for using our .NET SDK is **4.6.1**\\n\\nThen you can proceed to add the following packages from NuGet:\\n\\n*   `Speckle.DesktopUI`\\n*   `Speckle.Objects`\\n\\n![](data:image/png;base64,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

It\\'s geared towards an audience that is familiar with Javascript and web development, or at least not scared by it!\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ll be creating a very simple web app capable of:\\n\\n*   Authenticating a user through a Speckle server OAuth.\\n*   Search for stream\\'s available to the user.\\n*   Display commit data associated with a given stream.\\n*   Filter the data to be displayed.\\n*   Cache results in `localStorage` to _remember_ the app state across page reloads.\\n\\nLet\\'s get started! 🚀\\n\\nFollowing along\\n\\nIf too busy to follow all the steps, you can find the entire code for this guide [in this repository (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-demo-app)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#requirements)\\n Requirements\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guide should work in any platform (Mac/Linux/Windows). We\\'ll be using _VSCode_ as our IDE but you can use any other (even Notepad if your brave enough!).\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need to have Node installed, as well as `vue-cli` and have some basic understanding of how Vue works.\\n\\nInstalling the prerequisites\\n\\n**Node:** Probably the easiest way to manage your node installation is through `nvm`. On Windows, you can [use this guide (opens new window)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#install-nvm-windows)\\n. If on OSX, you can use the [original nvm (opens new window)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)\\n.\\n\\n**Vue CLI**: Once you have node installed, it\\'s just a matter of running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.\\n\\nGetting familiar with Vue\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t used Vue before, don\\'t worry. It\\'s quite easy to get started with it - here\\'s [some docs (opens new window)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)\\n you could run through beforehand.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also be using some of Vue\\'s most popular plugins: `vuex` and `vue-router`. If you\\'re unfamiliar with them, they have great quick-start guides on their site!\\n\\n*   [`vuex`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n*   [`vue-router`: Getting started (opens new window)](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/)\\n    \\n\\n[#](#setting-up-the-vue-app)\\n Setting up the Vue app\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the simplest step. Open a new terminal, set the current directory to wherever you want the project to be located and run the following command:\\n\\n    vue create speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nThis will ask you some questions, such as the version of vue to use, what plugins to install, etc. **It is important that you answer the questions correctly**, otherwise, your project may be missing some key features.\\n\\nVue setup - Step by step\\n\\n1.  When prompted for a preset, select **Manually select features** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step1.dcfa5f44.png)\\n2.  Next, specify the features needed for this project:\\n    *   Choose vue version\\n    *   Babel\\n    *   PWA\\n    *   Router\\n    *   Vuex\\n    *   CSS Pre-processors\\n    *   Linter ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step2.05778446.png)\\n3.  Choose version **2.x** of Vue.js ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step3.4097c34f.png)\\n4.  Choose **Yes** when prompted to use **history mode for router** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step4.ec673eac.png)\\n5.  For the css-preprocessor to use, select **Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step5.c8848709.png)\\n6.  When prompted for a Linter, choose the option **ESLint with error prevention only** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step6.fc39a92e.png)\\n7.  When prompted for additional lint features, select **Lint on save** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step7.d4eddbd5.png)\\n8.  Choose to place config files **In dedicated config files** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step8.cfe4baaf.png)\\n9.  At last, you can save this selection as a preset, but for this time just select **No** ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step9.b8f89232.png)\\n10.  Wait for the process to finish ![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup-step10.4d92a129.png) \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIf you are already familiar with this process, just select the same answers as the screenshot bellow:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vue-setup.55edbdef.png)\\n\\nOnce done, you\\'d have your Vue project ready. To open the project in **VSCode** we just need to run:\\n\\n    code speckle-demo-app\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nThis step assumes you already installed VSCode in your path. If you haven\\'t, there\\'s a command for it in VSCode.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-vscode-shell-install.df19f814.png)\\n\\n### [#](#install-other-dependencies)\\n Install other dependencies\\n\\nFor our UI, we\\'ll also be using [Vuetify](TODO)\\n to make our life easier, as it has many useful components. To add it, run:\\n\\n    vue add vuetify\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nWhen asked for a preset, choose **Default**.\\n\\nWe\\'ll also need to add a couple of handy dependencies such as `vuex-persist` for state storage, `vue2-timeago` to display user-friendly dates and `debounce`. For this, run the following command:\\n\\n    npm i vuex-persist vue2-timeago debounce\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#run-your-app-for-the-first-time)\\n Run your app for the first time\\n\\nIf everything went well, running the following command should make the app available at [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](http://localhost:8080)\\n.\\n\\n    npm run serve\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIn chrome, things should be looking like this:\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-setup-preview.a007a970.png)\\n\\n[#](#authenticating-with-the-server)\\n Authenticating with the Server\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#creating-the-speckle-files)\\n Creating the `Speckle` files\\n\\nFor convenience, we\\'re going to isolate all the `speckle` related code into 2 files:\\n\\n*   `src/speckleQueries.js` will hold some utility functions to build our `GraphQL` queries.\\n*   `src/speckleUtils.js` will hold all call\\'s to the Speckle server, as well as some constants. It will deal with login/logout functionality too.\\n\\n### [#](#registering-an-application-on-the-speckle-server)\\n Registering an Application on the Speckle Server\\n\\nIn order to be able to talk to our Speckle server, we first need to `Create an App` in that server with an existing account. To do that, visit the server\\'s frontend [https://app.speckle.systems (opens new window)](https://app.speckle.systems)\\n, log in with your account and visit the profile page.\\n\\nScroll down until you see the `Applications` section, and press the `New App` button. A pop-up should appear, fill it in as follows:\\n\\n*   **Name:** SpeckleDemoApp\\n*   **Scopes**: `stream:read`, `profile:read`, `profile:email`\\n*   **Redirect url**: `http://localhost:8080`\\n*   **Description**: My first speckle app\\n\\nOnce accepted, you\\'ll see the `App Id` and `App Secret`, as well as an indication to the url pattern we should use (`https://app.speckle.systems/authn/verify/{appId}/{challenge}`).\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nNote that the `redirect url` points to our local computer network. When deploying this app to a service like Netlify, we\\'ll have to create a new one pointing to the correct Netlify url.\\n\\n#### [#](#saving-app-credentials-as-env-variables)\\n Saving app credentials as ENV variables\\n\\nThe `App Id` and `App Secret` are used to identify your app, so you should never add them to your version control. Instead, we\\'ll be using `ENV` variables to save that information, which also allows us to modify it in different scenarios (development/production).\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor those of you who wonder, frontend applications that integrate with the Speckle Server are treated as OAuth **public applications**, because they cannot keep their id and secret safe.\\n\\nVue will automatically read any `.env` files in the root of your project and load the variables accordingly, but will also replace all references with the actual value of the variable on compilation (which we **do not want**). We can tell `vue.js` to not do this by creating a file named `.env.local` instead. The contents should look like this 👇🏼 (remember to replace your ID and Secret appropriately).\\n\\n    # The Speckle Application Id\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_ID=YOUR_APP_ID \\n    \\n    # The Speckle Application Secret\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET\\n    \\n    VUE_APP_SERVER_URL=https://app.speckle.systems\\n    VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME=\"Speckle Demo App\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n### [#](#login-in-with-speckle)\\n Login in with Speckle\\n\\nA simplified version of the auth flow with a Speckle Server can be summarised as follows:\\n\\n1.  User clicks the Login button\\n2.  User is redirected to the auth page in the Speckle server (using the provided url pattern when creating an application)\\n3.  User will log in and allow the app to access their data (hopefully?).\\n4.  User is redirected to our specified `Redirect URL`, with an attached `access_code`.\\n5.  Using that access code, we can exchange it for a pair of `token/refresh token`, which is what allows the app to \"talk\" to the server as that user. We\\'ll save those in `localStorage`.\\n\\nThis may sound rather complicated, but it boils down to 2 different interactions (redirect your user and exchange the access code).\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-auth-functions-to-speckleutils-js)\\n Adding auth functions to `speckleUtils.js`\\n\\nIn our `src/speckleUtils.js` file, paste in the following code. You\\'ll find some constants that refer to our previously set `ENV` variables, as well as several functions.\\n\\n*   `goToSpeckleAuthPage`: Will generate a random challenge, save it in localStorage and direct the url to the auth page in the specified speckle server.\\n*   `exchangeAccessCode`: Will `fetch` from the server a new pair of `token/refresh token` and clear the `challenge`.\\n*   `speckleLogOut`: Will erase all necessary data from `localStorage`.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nNote that `goToSpeckleAuthPage` saves the challenge, and `exchangeAccessCode` uses that same challenge to exchange the tokens. If the challenge used doesn\\'t match, the request will fail.\\n\\nspeckleUtils.js\\n\\n    export const APP_NAME = process.env.VUE_APP_SPECKLE_NAME\\n    export const SERVER_URL = process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URL\\n    export const TOKEN = `${APP_NAME}.AuthToken`\\n    export const REFRESH_TOKEN = `${APP_NAME}.RefreshToken`\\n    export const CHALLENGE = `${APP_NAME}.Challenge`\\n    \\n    // Redirects to the Speckle server authentication page, using a randomly generated challenge.

Selecting one of the result items will change the selection text from `No stream selected` to display the selected Stream name and id, as well as 2 buttons. The first one will take you to the stream page in the server, while the second one will clear the selection in the app state.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-stream-search.641f64ce.gif)\\n\\n[#](#displaying-stream-commits)\\n Displaying stream commits\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSo far, we\\'ve managed to authenticate with our Speckle server, fetch user and server information and search for available streams, as well as storing the results in our app state.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s use our `selectedStream` to display a table with all it\\'s commits, as well as some data associated with each commit. Since the commit list can be rather large, we\\'ll be adding basic pagination functionality to the table.\\n\\nFor that, we\\'ll need to fetch the commit data associated with the stream, modify our `store/index.js` to hold that new data, and add a table view with a column filter on `Home.vue`\\n\\n### [#](#create-fetch-query)\\n Create fetch query\\n\\nLet\\'s start by adding a new query function to our `speckleQueries.js`\\n\\n    export const streamCommitsQuery = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) => `query {\\n        stream(id: \"${streamId}\"){\\n          commits(limit: ${itemsPerPage}, cursor: ${\\n      cursor ? \\'\"\\' + cursor + \\'\"\\' : null\\n    }) {\\n            totalCount\\n            cursor\\n            items{\\n              id\\n              message\\n              branchName\\n              sourceApplication\\n              referencedObject\\n              authorName\\n              createdAt\\n            }\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }`\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nAnd add the following to `speckleUtils.js` (remember to import the `streamCommitsQuery`)\\n\\n    export const getStreamCommits = (streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor) =>\\n      speckleFetch(streamCommitsQuery(streamId, itemsPerPage, cursor))\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nNotice that the query has a `cursor`. This is used to get successive _pages_ of the commits list. There is a current limitation with the cursor, as it only allows to go _forward_ in pages, not backward. To fix this, we\\'ll keep track of these values in our store so we can have pagination going forward (we\\'ll also keep the `itemsPerPage` value fixed to keep things simple).\\n\\n[#](#update-store-index-js)\\n Update `store/index.js`\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, there\\'s quite a bit of modifications in the `store/index.js` file. I\\'ve highlighted the changes in the code block, but feel free to replace the whole content for the one bellow.\\n\\nWe basically need modify the state to be able to:\\n\\n*   Store the `latestCommits` data, a list of `previousCursors` and a list of `tableOptions` for the table visualization.\\n*   Add mutations to modify individually each of these state properties (note that `previousCursors` is a list, so we added two mutations: one to push a new value and another to replace the entire list)\\n*   Add `getCommits` action, and update `logout`, `handleStreamSelection` and `clearStreamSelection` to also deal with these new props.\\n\\nstore/index.js\\n\\n    import Vue from \"vue\"\\n    import Vuex from \"vuex\"\\n    \\n    import {\\n      APP_NAME,\\n

highlighted the changes in the code block, but just as the step below, feel free to replace the entire content if you\\'re playing it fast and loose!\\n\\nWe need to do the following modifications:\\n\\n*   Add a new `div` for the table view containing a `v-select` and a `v-data-table`.\\n    *   The `v-select` allows to select the available keys to display as table columns\\n    *   The `v-data-table` does all the table UI magic so we don\\'t have to.\\n*   Add several computed properties:\\n    *   `commits` and `previousCursors` to fetch the data from our store\\n    *   `availableKeys` and `filteredHeaders` are helper functions to extract all available keys from the received commit data and format the headers the way `v-data-table` likes them.\\n*   Add new data properties to the component:\\n    *   `options` will serve to keep the table options in sync\\n    *   `selectedKeys` is where we\\'ll save the user selected information to display as columns in the table.

Go ahead to [http://localhost:8080 (opens new window)](https://localhost:8080)\\n. If logged in, your app should be looking like this 👇🏼\\n\\n![](/assets/img/app-guide-full-demo.1024d106.gif)\\n\\n[#](#adding-data-persistence)\\n Adding data persistence\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur app seems to be working fine, but there\\'s still a small adjustment that we can do to make things better. If, for any reason, a user reloads the page, they will loose their current stream selection + commit results, which is annoying. Let\\'s fix that!\\n\\nThankfully, we only need to modify the `store/index.js` file slightly to make this happen. We already installed `vuex-persist`, the plugin that will do all the heavy lifting for us.\\n\\nFirst, import vuex-persist:\\n\\n    import VuexPersistence from \"vuex-persist\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nthen create an instance (you\\'ll need to import `APP_NAME` from `speckleUtils.js`) that uses `localStorage`. We could also use `sessionStorage`, which would be deleted at the end of the session.\\n\\n    const vuexLocal = new VuexPersistence({\\n      storage: window.localStorage,\\n      key: `${APP_NAME}.vuex`\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nadd a `plugins` property to the `Vuex.Store` constructor config:\\n\\n    export default new Vuex.Store({\\n      plugins: [vuexLocal.plugin],\\n      ...\\n    })\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nand that\\'s it! Your app should now persist the app state across page refresh. 🚀\\n\\n[#](#publish-to-netlify)\\n Publish to Netlify\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we have our app up and running locally, there\\'s just one last thing to do: deploy it!\\n\\nWe\\'ll be using Netlify for this guide, but you could also as easily use Heroku, or any other platforms that supports web-app s like Vue.js out of the box.\\n\\nFirst, you\\'ll need a GitHub account to push your app\\'s repo to, and a Netlify account. If you haven\\'t got a netlify account yet, you can log in with your GitHub account, which will make your life easier.\\n\\n### [#](#create-your-site)\\n Create your site\\n\\n1.  Go to your Netlify\\'s dashboard and find the `New site from Git` button ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site.88cb7d26.png)\\n2.  Follow the steps as shown:\\n    1.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-2.1f6bdff9.png)\\n    2.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-3.d288f521.png)\\n    3.  ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-new-site-4.ca2b8d4b.png)\\n    4.  Once this is done, you\\'ll have a netlify url where you\\'re app will live.\\n3.  Create a new Application on the Speckle server and set it\\'s callback url to the application url you just got from Netlify. This will give you a new `appId` and `appSecret`.\\n4.  Last step is to set the `env` variables, similar to how we did it for our development server.\\n    1.  Go to `Site Settings`\\\\->`Build and Deploy`\\\\-`Environment`\\n    2.  Add the same environment variables as in your `.env.local` file but using the `appId` and `appSecret` values from step 3. ![](/assets/img/app-guide-netlify-env.167695cc.png)\\n5.  Go to the `Deploys` section of your app, find the `Trigger Deploy` button and select the `Deploy Site` option. This will force your app to restart and detect the new env variables.\\n\\nThat\\'s it! If you visit your netlify url, you should see your app running smoothly!\\n\\n[#](#wrapping-it-up)\\n Wrapping it up\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve covered quite a lot on this guide, but this was only a small example of interacting with Speckle streams and commits.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-the-base-object/782)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe Base object is one of the smallest, yet most critical parts of our SDKs as it influences the serialisation & deserialisation process, hashing speed & correctness, overall performance, and how elements are defined in the Speckleverse. It\\'s the building block of Speckle.\\n\\nIn this page we\\'ll describe what it is and how to use it in more detail. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#using-base)\\n Using `Base`\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe base object class (actually called `Base`) is the foundation of all data being transferred with Speckle. Any custom data structure that you want to transfer via Speckle should inherit from it. You can read more on creating your own schemas in the [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n\\n`Base` inherits from a C# dynamic object. This allows us to be strongly typed when needed, but as well fall back elegantly on dynamic properties when we want to, or need to. Imagine a crossover between a JavaScript object and a strongly defined C# class. It\\'s quite cool! Furthermore, this removes some of the friction in aligning with our Python and JS implementations.\\n\\nThis is what it looks like:\\n\\n    // Simplified class definition:\\n    public class Base {\\n    \\tpublic string id { get; set; } // this is the unique hash, generated from the serialized object\\n        \\tpublic string applicationId { get; set; } // a secondary (optional) identity value, for example the host application object id\\n    \\tpublic string speckle_type { get; } // this is the discriminator comprised of assembly name and inheritance\\n    \\tpublic long totalChildrenCount { get; } // this is the total number of detachable objects\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n### [#](#direct-usage)\\n Direct Usage\\n\\nHere\\'s how you would use a \"raw\" `Base` object as a custom data structure. It\\'s essentially just a dynamic object at heart.\\n\\n    var myObject = new Base();\\n    \\n    // setting properties using dot notation requires cast to dynamic\\n    ((dynamic)myObject).myNewProperty = \"foo\";\\n    \\n    // alternatively, just pretend it\\'s a dictionary!\\n    myObject[\"myNewProperty2\"] = \"bar\";\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nYou can define singular objects like this - like something representing a built element; alternatively you can define your own object collection types based on the source application you\\'re working from.\\n\\n    var myCommit = new Base();\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A\"] = new List<Base>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-B\"] = new List<Point>() { ... };\\n    myCommit[\"RhinoLayer-A:RhinoLayer-C\"] = new List<String>() { ... };\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n✋ All property names will need to be serializable and some characters prevent this. With dot notation this is more obvious, but using the dictionary method, invalid prop names will only show up at serialization time. There is a helper function `IsPropNameValid` within `DynamicBase` that you could use to check whenever you are dealing with handling indeterminate properties from other software. It also checks for double special characters or overwritten instance property names.\\n\\n### [#](#inherited-usage)\\n Inherited Usage\\n\\nOf course, you can define custom classes that inherit from `Base` and define strongly typed properties in there, which can then be accessed as usual; these can easily coexist alongside dynamic ones.\\n\\n    public class Point : Base {\\n      // define a set of strongly typed properties\\n      public double x { get; set; }\\n      public double y { get; set; }\\n      public double z { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Strongly typed props behave as you would expect them to:\\n    var myPt = new Point();\\n    myPt.x = 10;\\n    var whatIsX = myPt.x;\\n    \\n    // With a dynamic property, things are a bit more verbose, but still manageable:\\n    ((dynamic)myPt).bar = \"baz\";\\n    var whatIsBar = ((dynamic)myPt).bar as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    // Alternative syntax, if you actually pass the property name at runtime:\\n    var whatIsBar = myPt[\"bar\"] as string; // \"baz\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nSetting a dynamic property that overlaps with a strongly typed one will actually just set the strongly typed one 🙂\\n\\nAll kit object models are inheriting from the `Base` object class for their object definitions. This ensures that Speckle will be able to transport them!\\n\\n[#](#detaching)\\n Detaching @\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen defining your dynamic `Base` object properties, you can detach them by prepending an `@` to your property name like so:\\n\\n    public class Foo : Base { }\\n    public class Bar : Base { }\\n    \\n    var foo = new Foo();\\n    var bar = new Bar();\\n    \\n    foo[\"@bar\"] = bar;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nDetaching a property stores that property value as a reference to another object. Why do this? Since it\\'s possible to nest your `Base` inherited class objects, detaching any properties that may be assigned an object used by other objects keeps your data squeaky clean. Since detached objects are only serialized once during transport, detaching when appropriate means faster sending and receiving times as well ⚡\\n\\nFor a more in depth rundown of detachables and examples, check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#hashing)\\n Hashing\\n----------------------\\n\\nAs you may or may not know, objects in Speckle are immutable. That means that if you change a property of one, it essentially gets a whole new identity; it\\'s a whole new object (as far as the storage layer is concerned). This immutability is enforced through unique hashes that are dependent on the object\\'s properties.\\n\\nAs a developer, you don\\'t need to care about all this 🙌. Our SDKs takes care of correctly setting the hash of an object, at the correct time: at the end of the serialisation process. There\\'s another purely cosmetic change that we made: the hash is now stored in an field called `id`. Why? Mostly so it\\'s clear that it\\'s the single object identity mechanism that **should** be used across all storage layers.\\n\\nWhat about operations that are dependent on hashes? From our analysis of existing programmatic usage, you rarely really need the hash of an object before serialising (and, implicitly, storing it somewhere). When retrieving objects from \"somewhere\" (more on this in another post), the hash already exists, so you can check against an existing application state and manage updates.\\n\\n    var x = myObject.id; // will be populated only if this object has been previously serialised!\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nIf you really need the hash (id!) before serialising it, don\\'t panic! You can still generate it - nevertheless we\\'ve put that behind an explicit function call so you, as a developer, are aware of the extra cost that you will be incurring. Here\\'s how the signature of that function looks like:\\n\\n    /// <summary>\\n    /// Gets the id (a unique hash) of this object. ⚠️ This method fully serializes the object, which in the case of large objects (with many sub-objects), has a tangible cost.\\n    /// <para><b>Hint:</b> Objects that are retrieved/pulled from a server/local cache do have an id (hash) property pre-populated.</para>\\n    /// <para><b>Note:</b>The hash of a decomposed object differs from the hash of a non-decomposed object.</para>\\n    /// </summary>\\n    /// <param name=\"decompose\">If true, will decompose the object in the process of hashing.</param>\\n    /// <returns></returns>\\n    public string GetId(bool decompose = false) { }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nNoticed that `decompose` flag? You\\'re sharp - check out the [decomposition API section](/dev/decomposition)\\n for more.\\n\\n[#](#the-speckle-objects-kit)\\n The Speckle Objects Kit\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOur SDKs come with our in-house Objects Kit comprised of `Base` inherited classes for your standard AEC needs. The core geometry kit contains all your basic elements like Points, Lines, Curves, and Breps, which are then used as properties for our more extensively defined BIM, Structural, and Civil elements. Read more in our [Objects section](/dev/objects)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#displaying-base)\\n Displaying `Base`\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn addition to the `Base` properties in our model above, you may also encounter certain common properties when exploring your data in our web viewer. The objects in our Objects Kit come with properties that we use to display them in our frontend:\\n\\n    // Class definition with additional display properties\\n    public class Foo : Base {\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; } // Mesh objects that represent the geometry of this Base object, e.g. used to render surfaces, or solid objects in our viewer\\n    \\t// or\\n    \\t[DetachProperty]\\n    \\tpublic Polyline displayValue { get; set; } // a polyline used to render complex curve objects in our viewer\\n    \\t\\n    \\tpublic Box bbox { get; set; } // a bounding box used to assist with object selection in our viewer\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is a **special property** within the Objects kit. It is common for classes inheriting `Base` to represent complex, conceptual, or domain specific objects. The `displayValue` property can be used to provide a **geometric representation** to help display the object in applications that don\\'t have a native form.\\n\\nFor example, When receiving **BIM types** like `Wall`, `Floor`, `Beam`, etc into a **non-BIM application** like Rhino, Unity, or our web viewer, these applications **have no way of rendering these elements natively**. The `displayValue` property represents **fallback** geometry, that will automatically be used by applications when receiving types without a native conversion.\\n\\nThe `displayValue` property is expected to be either an **object inheriting `Base`** or a **`List` of objects inheriting `Base`**. Ideally, these types **should be simple geometry types** like `Mesh` or `Polyline` as these can be converted in all (or almost all) receiving applications (However, this rule isn\\'t enforced for custom `Base` objects, and in theory, any type inheriting `Base` can be used .)\\n\\n[#](#collections)\\n Collections\\n------------------------------\\n\\nWhether to represent Layers, Categories, Tags, Collections, Groups, or hierarchical containers, it is common to see a natural grouping of objects within a 3D model. The `Collection` type provides a unified way to represent hierarchical collections of Speckle objects in a queryable, filterable way and is useful for interoperability between applications.\\n\\nA collection object only has three properties (in addition to those inherited from the `Base` Speckle object) and is completely kit/domain agnostic.\\n\\n> `name` - Any (non-empty) human-readable `string` name, one not necessarily unique.\\n> \\n> `collectionType` - Any `string` value describing the type of collection, used for convenience, and specific interop.\\n> \\n> `elements` - A `List<Base>` representing child objects, may include nested `Collection` objects.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOur new front-end (fe2) is designed to display `Collection` in the scene explorer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/fe2-collections.4509cd2c.gif)\\n\\nSuppose we look at how Collection objects are used inside Speckle versions. We see within the Collection’s `elements` property; we can expect any objects to be nested, including sub-collections.\\n\\nImportantly, however, we only see `Collection` objects nested under other `Collections`. Unlike other speckle objects which may form any [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n structure, Collections must be in a true directed tree structure.\\n\\n> ![](/assets/img/collection-tree-structure.2601314c.png)\\n> \\n> Diagram of collections within a Speckle commit, illustrating collections can contain both sub-collections and other objects under the `elements` property. While the `elements` property of geometry objects do not contain Collections\\n\\nWith the exception of the Revit connector, connectors will send `Collection`s from the layer/tag/collection structure.\\n\\n| Rhino | Blender | Sketchup |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| ![](/assets/img/rhino-collections.cbb5593a.png) | ![](/assets/img/blend-collections.a23747e7.png) | ![](/assets/img/skp-collections.26fa690d.png) |\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/base.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Architecture](/dev/architecture.html) [Decomposition API](/dev/decomposition.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

You\\'ll be ready to make the most out of what Speckle has to offer.\\n\\nYou will know how you could create your own backend to Speckle, how data flows and how you can control those flows, how data is stored, as well as how applications interact with Speckle and can use it as a data persistence framework.\\n\\nSpeckle is the open source data platform built for the AEC industry. What does this platform do? Put simply, Speckle consists of a set of infrastructural components needed to **store** and **retrieve** data.\\n\\n### [#](#data)\\n Data\\n\\nSome of these applications are authoring tools - such as Revit and Rhino - and other applications are SPA web apps, other more fully fledged backend apps - including scripts, serverless functions, etc.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/unfold.e179bf8d.png)\\n\\nThese applications, in order to talk to each other and make sense of the data they are consuming, need to speak a common language. The design and principles of this common language are centred around **composability** and **extensibility,** and **not** around **completeness**. This makes Speckle much more approachable than, for example, IFC.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\n[Here\\'s an article](/dev/base)\\n through how we implemented this approach in our .NET SDK.\\n\\n[#](#kits)\\n Kits\\n----------------\\n\\nA Speckle kit is, essentially, the definition of a common language: a schema. Moreover, a Speckle kit also contains the translation routines to and from an application\\'s native object model to the kit\\'s schema. Kits are \"hot-swappable\": Speckle comes with one by default which delivers the core of our interoperability capabilities. Nevertheless, anyone can define their own kit to serve their purpose.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/kits.e6428454.png)\\n\\nExisting authoring applications, such as Rhino, Revit, Autocad, send and receive data from and to Speckle by passing it through the conversion routines of a given kit. This is handled through **connectors.** Connectors are plugins that integrate within these host applications (e.g., the Rhino Connector) and allow end-users to select the data they want to send to Speckle, and, behind the scenes, convert it and, lastly, transport it to Speckle.\\n\\nExtra Reading\\n\\nRead more about **kits** [here](/dev/kits)\\n. If curious, you can also follow up with the discussion on [our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/introducing-kits-2-0/710)\\n.\\n\\nWe also have a guide on how to write your own **connector** - [check it out](/dev/connectors-dev.html)\\n!\\n\\nOther applications do not necessarily need to do so: they can directly use a kit\\'s schema - or simply use objects that respect the few low-level constraints that Speckle needs to serve its purpose. These aspects are described below in [Serialisation & Structure](#serialisation-structure)\\n. Next, we\\'re going to discuss how the serialisation layer interacts with the storage layer.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-storage)\\n Serialisation and Storage\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce Speckle data is translated or directly created, it needs to be serialised and, lastly, stored. In reverse, data needs to be retrieved from the storage layer and de-serialised to a memory representation that can be used by the application it was received in (either converted back to host application representations, or consumed by the business logic of the app. During the process of serialisation, Speckle also needs to decompose objects into their constituent parts; similarly, it needs to re-compose them during the de-serialisation process.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/serialisation.7d9aa653.png)\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper into Speckle\\'s decomposition and re-composition procedures, we will first take a look at how the storage layer is handled in Speckle and the flexibility it offers.\\n\\n[#](#transports)\\n Transports\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDifferent storage systems have various characteristics that make them better (or more ill) suited for different scenarios. This is why, rather than employ a unique storage system, Speckle uses an intermediary abstraction layer: transports. A transport defines the way Speckle writes to, and reads from, a given persistence layer.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/transports.65882822.png)\\n\\nOne such transport is the Speckle Server Transport. Another transport is an SQLite Transport. Speckle comes with a couple of other transports too: a MongoDB transport, an In-Memory Transport, as well as a Disk Transport. Other transports, such as an S3 transport, a MySQL transport could easily be developed.\\n\\nThe Disk Transport writes and reads your Speckle data from files in a location you specify, while the SQLite Transport does the same, but backed by a SQLite database. For example, the latter is used extensively throughout our connectors as a local cache so as to reduce the dependency on a high-latency transport, namely the one for the Speckle Server.\\n\\nTransports offer developers low-level flexibility in developing, essentially, their own custom back-ends to Speckle, or pushing data to other systems that can do different things - even a whole new Speckle Server.\\n\\nMoreover, send operations are no longer restricted to one single location: Speckle allows you to send data, in parallel, to multiple transports. For example, data can be sent to two different Server Transports at the same time, one being an internal server and one being an external one - a different stakeholder involved in the process.\\n\\nAlternatively, a plugin based on Speckle could be developed that acts much more like git, writing data to a local folder that resides right next to the source file itself. This enables, in whatever configuration you see fit, a local only usage of Speckle, with pushing to remotes being a secondary, optional operation.\\n\\nExtra reading\\n\\nA work-in-progress guide on how to write your own transport can be found [here](transports-dev)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#serialisation-and-structure)\\n Serialisation and Structure\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore data can be persisted to a storage system, it needs to be serialised. Serialisation is the process by which an object is converted into a state that can be stored or transmitted, and be reconstructed later from (deserialisation).\\n\\nObjects are, by their nature, structured data. The object graph and, implicitly, its structure, gives it meaning. Serialising a whole object graph in a naive way would result into a large blob which would be difficult to work with, and exclude certain workflows - such as reading just subsets of the graph, or individual objects - without deserialising the whole structure first. Storage systems, such as databases, work best with what we call \"flat\" data: individual rows, each corresponding to a given object.\\n\\nSpeckle solves this structural impedance mismatch by deconstructing an object into its individual constituent parts during the process of serialisation. These individual objects are then sent for storage to any given transports.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/deconstruction.c0422666.png)\\n\\nEach object, when serialised, gets a unique id which is generated by hashing its value. This means that all objects are immutable: if they change throughout their lifecycle, they get a new hash.\\n\\nThese object hashes are also used to assemble, for each individual object, its internal graph references. What this means, essentially, is that each Speckle object contains the information needed for reconstructing its full graph of descendants - alongside its own data.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/reconstruction.4927e890.png)\\n\\nAt the heart of `git` there are two types of objects: trees and blobs. Blobs represent the files themselves, and trees represent the file structure. **Objects in Speckle are, essentially, both a tree and a blob at the same time** - the \"blob\" being the value of the object itself, and the tree representing its object graph. While git sources its tree from the folder structure of your project, Speckle sources it from the object graph itself.\\n\\nWhen deserialising data, Speckle reconstructs it at the same time. This means that data can reside and make use of the upsides of storage systems such as relational databases, while at the same time, developers are not constrained as to how they structure it and can continue working with it freely inside their applications.\\n\\nAnother important note is that Speckle uses JSON as the native serialisation format for the object \"blobs\".

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-decomposition-api/911)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers how Speckle deals with the structure and composition of design data. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#blobs-and-trees)\\n Blobs and Trees\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nDesign and construction data is mostly relational: **built elements link to each other.** Despite this, there is no canonical way of structuring it. How do they relate to each other? Well, it depends!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/cb099e4d3a8553053869d791f0ce1fcaebca3c7a_2_690x295.png)\\n\\nFor example, a `Site` object may contain one or more `Building` objects. These, in turn, may contain one more `Levels`, and each of these `Levels` may contain some `Walls`, `Floor` and `Beam` elements. Or, those `Building` objects may each individually reference the same `Site`. Within the `Building` object, there\\'s all the `Walls` and `Beams`, and each of them, rather than being grouped under a `Level`, they individually reference a specific `Level`.\\n\\nIn order to solve this, we\\'ve taken a good look at how git, the ubiquitous version control system, works. Git operates with two object types: blobs and trees. Blobs represent files, and an important characteristic is that they are immutable - just like objects are in Speckle. Trees represent folders, and they are used to track the hierarchy of the folder structure of your repository.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you think this analogy hints to more, you\\'re right: Speckle is becoming a fully fledged version control system for design data. Keep an eye out 😎\\n\\nAs opposed to Git, that deals with data structured on your hard drive, Speckle deals with data structured in memory. In Speckle, an object is, at the same time, both a blob (data) and a tree (its subcomponents). There are two separate, yet interweaved, problems (and their corollaries) that I\\'ll now address:\\n\\n*   How to decompose an object? _(Corollary: how to recompose an object?)_\\n*   How to serialise, transport and store that decomposed object? _(Corollary: how to retrieve and deserialise an object?)_\\n\\n[#](#decomposing)\\n Decomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThere is no right or wrong way to structure design data. Different applications operate with different models, different use-cases require different hierarchies, different disciplines and professionals operate with differently structured ontologies.\\n\\nSpeckle now has a mechanism by which, in the process of specifying an object - either via a strongly typed kit, or via dynamic properties - developers (and end-users) can decide what gets decomposed and what doesn\\'t.\\n\\n### [#](#strongly-typed-detachment)\\n Strongly Typed Detachment\\n\\nIt works, in the case of strongly typed properties, by adding the Speckle specific attribute `[DetachProperty]` on the properties you want to store as references, rather than within the object itself.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s take an imaginary set of classes:\\n\\n    public class Building : Base {\\n      [DetachProperty] // this attribute tells Speckle to store the value of the Site separately.\\n      public Site Site { get; set; }\\n      public List<Level> Levels { get; set; }\\n      public Owner { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public class Level : Base {\\n      public double height { get; set; } = 3.2;\\n      public double baseElevation {get; set; } = 0;\\n    \\n      [DetachProperty]\\n      public List<Base> Elements { get; set; } // The actual walls, floors, columns, etc.\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Define a site globally\\n    var mySite = new Site();\\n    \\n    // Reference the same site in both buildings.\\n    buildingA.Site = mySite;\\n    buildingB.Site = mySite;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nWhen an instance of the Building class gets saved, the `Site` will be stored separately. If two Buildings share the same `Site`, it will be stored only once, and each instance of the `Building` class will hold a reference to the same `Site`.\\n\\nIn our example, each Level can hold, in a _detachable_ property, all its walls, beams, ducts, pipes, furniture, and other built elements. Consequently, each of these elements will be individually accessible from the storage layer, and will maintain topological unity. Why is this important? Let\\'s imagine a building with a series of levels separated by floor slabs. **The slab between two levels pertains to which level: the bottom one, or the top one?**\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/original/1X/3ea9d660024d5f3545933133165737e063fa87d5.png)\\n\\nCollections\\n\\nThe most generic class used in Speckle is the `Collection` class. The `Collection` class is a `Base` class that has the `elements` property, which is a `List<Base>`. This means that any object that inherits from `Base` can be stored in a `Collection` object. This is a very powerful concept, as it allows us to store arbitrary data structures in Speckle, without paying any penalties. While it is mostly used for representing parent-child relationships, those children can be of any type, and because `elements` is detached they can also be stored in multiple collections.\\n\\n### [#](#dynamic-detachment)\\n Dynamic Detachment\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this through an example that also demonstrates how dynamically added properties can be detached. We\\'ll assume that we will dynamically set `topSlab` and `bottomSlab` properties to each level in our imaginary object model:\\n\\n    // We\\'re grossly simplifying in this example. Here are our two building levels:\\n    var level_1, level_2;\\n    \\n    // The philosophical slab instance. Does it belong to level 1 or level 2?\\n    var slab_between_1_and_2 = new Slab();\\n    \\n    // Well, it belongs to both! Notice the \"@\" character at the beginning of\\n    // the dynamic property assignment - it\\'s the Speckle convention for \"detaching\"\\n    // dynamically added properties.\\n    level_1[\"@topSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    level_2[\"@bottomSlab\"] = slab_between_1_and_2;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n\\nBecause we\\'ve prepended the property name with an \"@\" symbol, Speckle will now \"detach\" it. Consequently, once stored, both level one and two will now hold a reference to a single slab! Beyond storage efficiency - the slab is only stored once - **this approach gives us the freedom to structure data however is best and, simultaneously, query, slice and dice it however we need to.**\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s assume you need to do a quantity takeoffs:\\n\\n*   For each each individual level: specify the total surface area, including walls, ceilings, etc. Solution: simply retrieve each level individually!\\n*   For the whole building: calculate the total volume of concrete that goes into the slabs. Solution: just query the building object for all the slabs!\\n\\nSimilarly, imagine you\\'ve written a script that does environmental analysis on a given level. The level can now be retrieved in its entirety - without juggling around to bring in the level above it too, just to get the ceiling out. Once the results are calculated, they can be stored in a detachable property on that specific level (e.g., `level_1[@\"solarComfortMeshWithColours\"] = analysisResultMesh;`). Later down the line in your workflow, one can could query for all the \"`solarComfortMeshWithColours`\" objects individually for each level, or, if needed, for the whole building.\\n\\n[#](#recomposing)\\n Recomposing\\n------------------------------\\n\\nRecomposition of an object happens within the deserialisation process, and it\\'s tightly integrated with the transport layer. The process, on the surface, is deceivingly simple. When you ask Speckle to receive a specific object, the process is as follows:\\n\\n*   Speckle retrieves said object\\'s \"blob\" (actually a JSON string representation of it),\\n*   Next up, Speckle retrieves at all the reference tree of this object,\\n*   Speckle proceeds to deserialise and re-compose the parent object, inserting in the place of references the actual referenced object.\\n\\nWether or not this sounds complicated, the exposed API is actually rather simple and the end result is that a decomposed object, when received back, will be identical with the original one - with all its parts in place 💥\\n\\n[#](#chunking)\\n Chunking\\n------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#problem)\\n Problem\\n\\nSome list properties of various objects can get very large. Examples:\\n\\n*   a Brep with many faces will have a Surfaces list prop containing 1000s of potentially heavy Surfaces.\\n*   a mesh with 100k+ vertices and faces.\\n\\nThis results in a clunky (memory heavy) serialisation process and can be unsafe (read: cause breakages) due to memory limitations.\\n\\n### [#](#solutions)\\n Solutions\\n\\nIn order of preference. Note that they are not exclusive, and they build on top of each other:\\n\\n*   First, optimise the list property so it\\'s more lightweight\\n*   Second, chunk the list property\\n\\n### [#](#first-port-of-call-optimise-the-list-property-🧪)\\n First Port of Call: Optimise the List Property 🧪\\n\\nFor example, you might be tempted to define a mesh like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        public List<Point> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nA much more efficient way is to define it like this:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n      // Typed array of 3\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; }\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n\\nInstead of storing each individual vertex as a point, you store them in a typed array. Serialisation will be much faster and leaner.\\n\\n### [#](#second-port-of-call-use-the-chunkable-attribute-🆕)\\n Second Port of Call: Use the `Chunkable` Attribute 🆕\\n\\nIn some cases you might be too lazy to actually optimise the storage of a list property, or it might be too convenient to use the class itself.\\n\\nAlternatively, you might still have a simple `List<double>` that expands to millions+ of items, like in the case of a very large mesh.\\n\\nIn the cases above, the best way is to mark the property as `Chunkable` together with `[DetachProperty]`. This will tell the serialiser that it should split it into manageable chunks of items, the size of which you can control.\\n\\nHere\\'s how that looks like currently in the mesh class:\\n\\n    public class Mesh : Base\\n    {\\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> vertices { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> faces { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<int> colors { get; set; } = new List<int>();\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        [Chunkable(20000)] // Chunks this array into batches of 20k numbers\\n        public List<double> textureCoordinates { get; set; } = new List<double>();\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nPotential Footguns\\n\\nThe DetachProperty attribute by itself can be a performance footgun in some scenarios: for example, if you have a `List<Point>` that can grow really big and you mark it as detachable, without marking it as chunkable, each individual point in that list will be stored as a separate entity.\\n\\nThis is bad: serialisation and deserialisation will take longer, and it essentially amounts to bad object model design (in speckle terms of course).\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nEnd users and developers can now productively control the way they structure their design data through the decomposition mechanism. From the point of view of the future Speckle connectors, this will enable us to expose object model flexibility in a more elegant way than before to end users. As developers, Speckle gives you another powerful API on top of which you can scaffold your digital automation workflows.\\n\\nMore importantly, this allows you to store arbitrary data structures (scaffolded on top of a `Base`) with Speckle, without paying any penalties: **Speckle deals equally well with flat and nested data.**\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/decomposition.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [The Base Object](/dev/base.html) [Kits](/dev/kits.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\nWhen a connector needs to convert an object, it will only search for available conversion routines in the selected kit and will not automatically fall back on other kits - this might change in the future!\\n\\n![](https://speckle.community/uploads/default/optimized/1X/f9890eead0fb8aa7bbe141a6cf7dd16453b0d176_2_690x449.png)\\n\\n[#](#objects)\\n Objects\\n----------------------\\n\\nObjects is the name of our default kit.

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/core-2-0-transports/919)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#preamble)\\n Preamble\\n------------------------\\n\\nThis page covers what Transports are and do and the basic concepts behind them. [Here can read how to write your own transport](/dev/transports-dev)\\n. Please note that currently examples are only in C#, equivalent implementations are available in our other SDKs.\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the most common use-cases we\\'ve encountered throughout the past 5 years of interacting with developers from the AEC space is \"dumping data somewhere\", and, obviously, getting it back out again. While this can, of course, be done by using the Speckle server, some situations call for a different storage type or database. We\\'ve seen people looking to use files on a network drive, Azure SQL provisions, MongoDB, Excel files, and sometimes [core rope memory (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory)\\n (joking, we\\'ve never seen that one - yet!).\\n\\nAn important part of our mission at Speckle is to empower developers across AEC. We want to give you a leg up so you can \"automate all the things\" and build powerful applications that leverage modern tech.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports give developers in the AEC space full control over where and how their data is stored.\\n\\nYou can now switch, choose and mix various storage layers. This allows us to write better, more memory efficient and predictable connectors. It also allows you, as a developer, to use Speckle as a springboard in your development work in a much more flexible way.\\n\\n[#](#definitions)\\n Definitions\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we dive in and see how they work, let\\'s get some definitions out of the way:\\n\\n### [#](#transports-2)\\n Transports\\n\\nIn Speckle, transports take Speckle Objects from memory and persist it to a specific storage layer. Of course, they\\'re also responsible for taking those objects out of the storage layer and back into memory.\\n\\n### [#](#storage-layers)\\n Storage Layers\\n\\nThe storage layer that a transport writes to can be, ultimately, anything you want it to be. The .NET SDK implements already a few of them, specifically:\\n\\n*   an SQLite Transport\\n*   an In-Memory Transport\\n*   **a Speckle Server 2.0 Transport**\\n*   a Disk Transport\\n*   a MongoDB Transport\\n\\nOther possible targets for transports can be S3 storage, a network drive, etc. You can also write a transport that writes to more than one place, but we advise against it - the .NET SDK provides a better way to achieve the same thing.\\n\\nMoreover, in the case of disk based transports (ie, disk, sqlite, etc.) you can also **control the location** of where this data is stored.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data-serialisation-and-writing)\\n Sending Data: Serialisation and Writing\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSerialisation is a potentially quite wasteful operation depending on the size of the data. One of our goals is to be able to support arbitrarily large models without adding too much overhead.\\n\\n> Why can serialisation be wasteful, especially in terms of memory usage? Imagine you have a model with 100k building objects (geometry & data) open in an application. To send that model to Speckle, we would need to (1) convert those objects into Speckle objects, using a given converter, then (2) serialise them to whatever format we\\'d be ingesting down the line (e.g., a JSON string), and, finally, (3) transport them to Speckle. Over the course of these steps, your computer\\'s memory holds **_three_** representations of the same object - Native, Speckle, and String. Not that cool! To reduce memory overhead, Speckle now integrates serialisation with writing objects to one or more persistence layers via transports. Whenever an object finishes serialisation, it\\'s sent to a transport for storage, and ultimately, its string representation gets \"garbage collected\". Just like this, we\\'ve knocked off some memory usage.\\n\\nThe 2.0 API exposes two lower level methods for sending (serialising and writing) and receiving (reading and deserialising) data. In this section, we\\'ll look at only at the send one - the section below will provide more detail on receiving data.\\n\\nFirst off, let\\'s start with the simplest, default, use case:\\n\\n    // First, let\\'s create a simple base object to store our building data in.\\n    var myData = new Base();\\n    myData[\"@columns\"] = new List<Columns>() { ... the columns };\\n    myData[\"@rooms\"] = new List<Rooms>() { ... the rooms};\\n    \\n    // Let\\'s now send the data:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nLooks quite simple! In this scenario, the `Send` method serialised and saved the `myData` object, together with all its detachable `columns` and `rooms` to the default Speckle local transport (an SQLite db stored in `~/AppData/Speckle`), and returned the id (hash) of the `myData` object, which you can use to receive it back again.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at a more advanced example:\\n\\n    var myRevisionId = await Operations.Send(\\n    \\tmyData,\\n    \\ttransports: new ITransport[] {\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // imagine this one server...\\n    \\t  new ServerTransport( args ), // ... and this is a different one! you\\'re basically pushing to multiple remotes!\\n    \\t  new MyCustomTransport( args ) // ... and, why not another transport?\\n      }\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening here is that we\\'re passing in multiple transports to the Send method. Speckle will persist the given object, with all its detachable sub-children, to all these transports, and, when done, return the object\\'s id (hash!).\\n\\n[#](#receiving-data-reading-and-deserialisation)\\n Receiving Data: Reading and Deserialisation\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, let\\'s start with the simplest use-case possible:\\n\\n    // To set the stage, in the previous code sample, we\\'ve done:\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send( myData );\\n    \\n    // Now, we want to get it back out. It\\'s as simple as:\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive( myDataId );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nThis just retrieves the object back using the default SQLite Transport. No accounts, no extra HTTP requests, no hassle. Of course, this is enough only for \"local\" operations that are bound to a single computer only.\\n\\nIf you want this to work across a local network, you can always create a SQLite Transport (or your own custom transport for that matter) that stores data on a network accessible drive. For large collaborative environments, you can, of course, receive your data from a Speckle Server.\\n\\nWhile you can Send data to multiple places at the same time, you can\\'t really receive data from more places at the same time. Hence, `Receive` can only accept one transport as the source:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n    \\tmyDataId,\\n    \\tremoteTransport: new ServerTransport( ... ) // where you want to receive things from!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\nDone! `myData` is now your data - a nicely deserialised Base object.\\n\\n[#](#advanced-transports)\\n Advanced Transports\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Send and Receive functions in the examples above assume **a shared global cache** located in `~/User/.config/Speckle`. In the case of Send, this means that objects will be written to a SQLite Transport that is used by Speckle always; in the case of Receive, the same SQLite Transport will be used to buffer to/from the remote transport.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are some use cases where you don\\'t want to, or cannot, use the shared global cache. For example, you would want to go full on classic version control, and store your history right next to your project\\'s file:\\n\\n    `-- MyProject_A            # root folder\\n        |-- .speckle           # the \".git\" folder\\n        |   |-- references.db  # commits, branches, tags, etc. storage\\n        |   `-- objects.db     # object storage\\n        `-- MyProject_A.rvt    # source file\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nHow would you actually implement such a system?\\n\\nFirst, you can always customise the location of your transport. For example, in the case of the SQLite Transport, you can specify a folder where to actually create it. Let\\'s assume we want to send our data to only two transports, a local SQLite one that\\'s sitting in the `.speckle` folder just next to our Revit file, and a Speckle Server.\\n\\n    var customLocalTransport = new SQLiteTransport( basePath: @\"{localFolderPath}/.speckle\" );\\n    var serverTransport = new ServerTransport(...);\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThe `Send` method can take an optional `useDefaultCache: false` argument to bypass the global cache, and send exclusively to the provided transports:\\n\\n    var myDataId = await Operations.Send(\\n      myData,\\n      transports: new ITransport[] { customLocalTransport, serverTransport },\\n      useDefaultCache: false // will bypass the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nWhen receiving data, if you want to use your custom local transport, the method would look like this:\\n\\n    var myData = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId: myDataId,\\n      remoteTransport: serverTransport,\\n      localTransport: customLocalTransport // will use this one instead of the global cache!\\n    );\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nAnother use case is in constrained environments, where you don\\'t have a persistent storage layer handy, such as a serverless function, or docker container. That\\'s where you would probably want to use a `MemoryTransport` - it\\'s obviously much faster and it doesn\\'t need to touch the disk.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nTransports give you, as a developer, a lot of flexibility in how you can use Speckle, so hopefully \"automating all the things\" will become a bit easier and nicer. They make it easy to customise your workflows and where and how you store data - from the Speckle Server, to one or more databases, local or remote.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/transports.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 8/1/2021, 10:56:30 AM\\n\\n← [Kits](/dev/kits.html) [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

Check out [the original on our forum (opens new window)](https://speckle.community/t/apps-authn-speckle-2-0/961)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#introduction)\\n Introduction\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a quick post on how authentication with the server works; we\\'ve put in _a lot_ of effort to make it easier for developers to extend the functionality of Speckle in their own apps, and simultaneously more secure for end users.\\n\\nBefore we start, we\\'d like to clarify that this post refers to specifically **authentication**, and not authorization.\\n\\n*   Authorization (authZ) controls **who has access to what resource**; it\\'s not the focus of this post.\\n*   Authentication (authN) controls **how a user can delegate access to other applications** (pieces of software) that then act on their behalf.\\n\\n[#](#api-tokens)\\n API Tokens\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAll access to the API is done through bearer tokens that need to present in the Authorization header of each request. There are several ways to create/obtain these tokens, which we\\'ll describe below. First, a few important notes on _tokens in general_:\\n\\n### [#](#token-scopes)\\n Token Scopes\\n\\nEach token has a set of associated scopes to it which **limit what actions it can do**. For example, you could have a token that is only allowed to read streams and your profile information. Alternatively, you could have a token that is allowed to search for other users on the server, read your existing streams, create new ones, etc.\\n\\nAs Speckle will grow with functionality, new scopes will be made available. Currently there are:\\n\\n    let coreModuleScopes = [\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"server:setup\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Edit server information.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your api tokens.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"tokens:write\",\\\\\\n        description: `Create and delete api tokens on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:read\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Read your streams & and any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"streams:write\",\\\\\\n        description:\\\\\\n          \"Create streams on your behalf and read your streams & any associated information (any associated information (branches, tags, comments, objects, etc.)\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read your profile information`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"profile:email\",\\\\\\n        description: `Access your email.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:read\",\\\\\\n        description: `Read other users\\' profile on your behalf.`,\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n      {\\\\\\n        name: \"users:email\",\\\\\\n        description: \"Access the emails of other users.\",\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\n    ];\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n38  \\n39  \\n40  \\n\\n### [#](#token-lifetime)\\n Token Lifetime\\n\\nTokens also have a certain lifetime after which they\\'re no longer valid. This helps with automatically blocking access to long forgotten apps. Written a little script two years ago that you\\'ve totally forgot about, but the token\\'s nicely pasted in the codebase since you\\'ve never published it? Well, now that\\'s safe even if someone else somehow snitches it - it probably expired.\\n\\n[#](#personal-access-tokens)\\n Personal Access Tokens\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs a developer, you can now create personal access tokens that you can use to delegate access to your script on your behalf, similar to how Github\\'s [Personal Access Tokens (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\\n work.\\n\\nWhen you create them, you can assign assign to them whatever scopes & lifetime you want to, just remember to limit both to the minimum to be _safe._\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTo create a new token head over `YOUR-SPECKLE-SERVER\\\\profile`\\n\\n[#](#apps)\\n Apps\\n----------------\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/109046703-f45be080-76cc-11eb-83b3-27ed956ff319.png)\\n\\nOnce you\\'re beyond the hacking phase, you\\'ll probably want to create & publish a speckle app that others can use. As a developer, you can:\\n\\n*   register apps that others can use (or not),\\n*   manage the apps you have created - edit name, description, redirect url, scopes, and delete.\\n\\nOnce an app is registered on a server, users can now delegate access to it for the set of scopes that the developer registered for that application. Once the delegation process is successful - the user approves it - they will get redirected to the url that the developer specified.\\n\\nOf course, as an end user, you have full control and visibility on the apps you have authorized. You can:\\n\\n*   see all your authorized apps (apps that you have granted access to),\\n*   revoke access to any of the above,\\n*   check out any publicly listed apps on this server (optional at this stage)\\n\\n### [#](#extras-on-app-types)\\n Extras on app types:\\n\\nNote: broadly speaking, there are two type of apps:\\n\\n*   Apps that act on behalf of a user - **supported ✅**\\n*   Apps that can act with their own identity - **not currently supported ⏱**\\n\\nWe\\'ll write soon more documentation on how the authentication flow with the Server actually works. For the geeks out there, here\\'s a short summary, or some important points:\\n\\n*   We are supporting the **authorization\\\\_code** flow with **PKCE** only for public and confidential clients.\\n*   We do not support dynamic scope requests for apps. We **only support pre-registered scopes for each app**.\\n*   If an app is edited in any way - name, scopes, etc. - all its tokens get revoked and users will need to re-authorize it.\\n\\nClients are usually split into two categories: public and private. Public clients cannot realistically hold a secret, whereas private ones can. For example, a front-end only web application is a public client; same goes for the desktop connectors. A private client can be a server-side application, which can realistically store an application secret in, for example, a .env file or provide it during the CI/CD process.\\n\\nClients are protected by:\\n\\n*   Using exclusively a pre-registered redirect URL.\\n*   Native apps (desktop): registering a custom application scheme (`speckle://`).\\n*   PKCE (Proof of Key For Code Exchange).\\n*   a client id & client secret, but the clientSecret is superfluous in the case of public clients.\\n\\n[#](#examples)\\n Examples\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe 2.0 server already comes with two applications that demonstrate this flow (warning - there might still be bugs). These are:\\n\\n*   The main web frontend application - accessible at the server\\'s default url, and\\n*   The GraphQL explorer - accessible at your server\\'s url + `/explorer`.\\n\\n[#](#summary)\\n Summary\\n----------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve put a lot of work into making Speckle developer friendly and extensible - and apps are just a small part of that. We hope that writing Speckle Apps will be fun and effective, and we can\\'t wait to see what you\\'ll do with them!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/apps-auth.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Transports](/dev/transports.html) [Introduction](/dev/dotnet.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

Together with it you might find useful [Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n, our default kit.\\n\\nCore and Objects are written in .NET Standard 2.0, they\\'ve been tested on Windows and MacOS and are being used by all our .NET based connectors.\\n\\n[#](#getting-started)\\n Getting Started\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore using them [please make sure they are supported by your .NET framework (opens new window)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support)\\n.\\n\\nWe have published various NuGets to make it simpler to use Speckle in your next .NET project. Here\\'s what\\'s available at the moment:\\n\\n*   Core\\n*   All Transports\\n*   Objects\\n*   All Objects Converters\\n\\nAll our NuGets are prefixed by `Speckle.`. Please don\\'t confuse them with the old v1 packages.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2679513/113474800-0833f880-946a-11eb-8c90-92b23918a0c8.png)\\n\\n[#](#how-to-use)\\n How to Use\\n----------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a quick summary of the main tasks Core helps you with:\\n\\n*   sending and receiving data to and from multiple transports\\n*   speckle kit management & data conversion (the interoperability core)\\n*   serialization and deserialization\\n\\nServer specific tasks:\\n\\n*   stream, branch and commit api calls\\n*   update notifications (subscriptions)\\n*   local account management\\n\\n[#](#structuring-your-data)\\n Structuring Your Data\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle allows you to structure your data in any way you like. Here\\'s a quick example:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    \\n    var myBuilding = new Base()\\n    \\n    myBuilding[ \"@floors\" ] = myFloors;\\n    myBuilding[ \"@walls\" ] = myWalls;\\n    myBuilding[ \"name\" ] = \"Southwood Park\"\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\nThe `Base` object behaves like a dictionary - with some added Speckle smarts - and lets you organically compose your data in any way you want.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nFor more advanced usage, check [the tests out (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Tests/BaseTests.cs)\\n! More on `Base` [can be found here](/dev/base)\\n\\nFor advanced use of `Base`, please see how our [BuiltElement classes (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements)\\n have been structured inheriting from `Base`.\\n\\n[#](#sending-data)\\n Sending Data\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSending data to Speckle is also pretty straightforward. Assuming you have SpeckleManager set up locally, all you need to do is:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    \\n    var commitId = Helpers.Send(\"Stream URL or ID\", data, \"My commit message\").Result;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#advanced-sending)\\n Advanced Sending\\n\\nIf you want more control on how and where to your data is Sent, just use some of our lower lever functions. For instance:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Transports;\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    var streamId = \"streamId\";\\n    var branchName = \"main\";\\n    var client = new Client(account);\\n    \\n    var transport = new ServerTransport(account, streamId);\\n    \\n    var objectId = await Operations.Send(\\n      data,\\n      new List<ITransport> { transport },\\n      useDefaultCache,\\n      onProgressAction,\\n      onErrorAction, disposeTransports: true);\\n    \\n    var commitId = await client.CommitCreate(\\n      new CommitCreateInput\\n      {\\n        streamId = sw.StreamId,\\n        branchName = branchName,\\n        objectId = objectId,\\n        message = message,\\n        sourceApplication = sourceApplication,\\n        totalChildrenCount = totalChildrenCount,\\n      });\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\n[#](#receiving-data)\\n Receiving Data\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nReceiving data from Speckle couldn\\'t be easier when using our SDKs. Assuming you have SpeckleManager set up locally, all you need to do is:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    \\n    var data = Helpers.Receive(\"Stream URL or ID\").Result;\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\nJust use a stream URL or Id to receive from. If the URL contains branchName, commitId or objectId those will be used, otherwise the latest commit from main will be received.\\n\\nThe `Helpers.Receive` takes optional arguments for specifying an `account` (otherwise the default will be used) and for progress/error reporting.\\n\\n### [#](#advanced-receiving)\\n Advanced Receiving\\n\\nIf you want more control on how and where from your data is Received, just use some of our lower lever functions. For instance, the code below receives the last commit of a stream from a specific branch:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Transports;\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    var streamId = \"streamId\";\\n    var branchName = \"main\";\\n    var client = new Client(account);\\n    var branch = await client.BranchGet(streamId, branchName, 1);\\n    var objectId = branch.commits.items[0].referencedObject; // take last commit\\n    \\n    var transport = new ServerTransport(account, streamId);\\n    \\n    var data = await Operations.Receive(\\n      objectId,\\n      remoteTransport: transport,\\n      onErrorAction: onErrorAction,\\n      onProgressAction: onProgressAction,\\n      onTotalChildrenCountKnown: onTotalChildrenCountKnown,\\n      disposeTransports: true\\n    );\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\n[#](#serializing-and-deserializing-data)\\n Serializing and Deserializing Data\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGetting a JSON representation of your data is easy:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Models;\\n    \\n    var json = Operations.Serialize(data);\\n    \\n    var data = Operations.Deserialize(json);\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\n[#](#using-the-net-sdk-without-manager)\\n Using the .NET SDK without Manager\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCore has been designed to be used in conjunction with Manager, that\\'s where the account information is basically pulled from.\\n\\nBut you can of course also use Core in environments where Manager is not available, for example in a serverless function. To do so (and avoid worrying about authentication), we first need to set up a [personal access token](/dev/tokens)\\n.\\n\\nThen, we can create a basic `Account` and pass it to a new `Client` and use the API as usual, see full example below:\\n\\n    using Speckle.Core.Api;\\n    using Speckle.Core.Credentials;\\n    using System;\\n    \\n    namespace SpeckleSampleApp\\n    {\\n      class Program\\n      {\\n        static void Main(string[] args)\\n        {\\n          var account = new Account();\\n          account.token = \"YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN\";\\n          account.serverInfo = new ServerInfo\\n          {\\n            url = \"https://app.speckle.systems/\"\\n          };\\n    \\n          var client = new Client(account);\\n          var stream = client.StreamGet(\"5dfbeb49c9\").Result;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nAlternatively, if you don\\'t want to use a personal access token you\\'d need to take care of the auth flow yourself, this functionality is not currently present in Core.\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/dotnet.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/3/2024, 8:37:44 PM\\n\\n← [Apps and Auth](/dev/apps-auth.html) [Filtering and Flattening Speckle Data in .NET](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

The most important sections you need to cover first are:\\n\\n*   [Structuring Data](/dev/dotnet.html#structuring-your-data)\\n    \\n*   [Receiving](/dev/dotnet.html#receiving-data)\\n    \\n\\nAs you know, Speckle data is structured according to the conventions of the host application, domain or mental model of the developer. There is no single canonical way in which data is structured!\\n\\nGenerally, working with structured data is a bit more difficult, as you need to parse the \"graph\", or the tree that describes its structure. Nevertheless, this doesn\\'t need to be so! What if we could access all the data inside a given commit and treat it just as any other list?

Without a method to navigate through complex, hierarchical data structures, you might end up with partial or incorrect data representations. Traversal provides a systematic way to explore Speckle data while capturing the relational context between objects.\\n\\nThe most basic way to consume Speckle objects is simply **[by flattening the Speckle data](/dev/FilteringData.html)\\n**, and consuming objects one by one. For many use cases, this is all that is required, but often it is necessary to consume Speckle objects **while capturing the hierarchical context of objects**.\\n\\n**In connectors**, this means traversing received Speckle data **to find convertible objects and their children**. In these cases, we are converting more than just objects one by one, but also **preserving the hierarchical tree** of parent/child relationships.\\n\\nSo, What is Traversal?\\n\\nIn practical terms, Traversal is **how we navigate Speckle data** and the relationships between Speckle Objects, to **consume objects with hierarchical context.**\\n\\nTo be concise, traversal aims to transform the [directed acyclic graph (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)\\n topology (_Think of it as a one-way network of objects; no loops allowed_) of a Speckle data **into a pure [tree (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory))\\n topology** (_a branching hierarchy_).\\n\\nThe structure of a Speckle data (e.g. from a version) differs depending on the data sent and from which connector. While it is possible to write code that manually traverses a specific version, by **hardcoding assumptions** its structure, it is often desirable to **write code that can consume any Speckle data, sent from any connector**. For this, it is necessary to understand the common **rules for how the connectors structure data**, and how this data can be traversed.\\n\\nThis concept is most useful in connectors when receiving and converting data, but the concept of traversal applies for any use case with the need to preserve and transform the structure of data.\\n\\nSimply iterating through all Speckle objects and consuming them individually is insufficient. Many types of **objects contain several representations** and reference geometry objects that are part of their definition (rather than separate displayable objects).\\n\\nTo illustrate this, consider how the `Wall` object is defined:\\n\\n    public class Wall : Base\\n    {\\n        public double height { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public ICurve baseLine { get; set; }\\n    \\n        public string units { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Base> elements { get; set; }\\n    \\n        [DetachProperty]\\n        public List<Mesh> displayValue { get; set; }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nThe `baseLine` curve forms part of the definition of the wall. And the `displayValue` provides a purely polygonal **mesh representation** of the mesh for display.\\n\\nA naïve function that consumes all objects one by one would **blindly consume** the baseline curve, and each mesh `displayValue` **without context** that it’s part of the Wall, nor do we have selectivity to choose which representation is use.\\n\\nFor these objects, it is necessary to be **selective about which properties should be traversed deeper**.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/selective-traversal.9b472fa6.png)\\n\\nWithin the Speckle connectors, **A `Wall` object is considered a convertible object**; the `baseLine` and `displayValue` representations **should be ignored** from being traversed.\\n\\nThis is where traversal functions come into play. These functions **encode the “rules” for which properties should be traversed**. And provides a convenient way to traverse Speckle data without making connector-specific assumptions about its structure.\\n\\nThe **Default Traversal Function** provides a de jure method of traversing Speckle objects, designed around a Speckle converter. This function is used by most of our connectors (with slight deviation) when receiving Speckle objects.\\n\\nIn general, a connector considers an object to be either:\\n\\n*   Convertible directly through a `ToNative` function\\n*   Convertible using displayValue (through a fall-back display value)\\n*   Convertible indirectly (through another conversion, as is the case for, say, `RenderMaterial`)\\n*   Not convertible at all\\n\\nDifferent connectors will have **different definitions of a “convertible” object**. There is no definitive list of “convertible” Speckle types. Connector-specific flexibility allows for **targeted interop** workflows and allows for the **intricacies of each host application**.\\n\\nAs part of the default traversal rules, we selectively traverse the properties of “convertible” objects. Only traversing `\"elements\"` (and its alias `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nAll other non-”convertible” objects will be traversed blindly (i.e. they have all properties traversed).\\n\\nCollections are a special case, As we handle them slightly differently depending on the connector. Some connectors (on receive) ignore all collection structures and convert objects the best way the native application allows. Others will use them to construct Layers, Tags, Collections, Groups etc.\\n\\nBe careful when dynamically attaching data to `Collection` objects to avoid inconsistent behaviour. We would advise keeping `\"elements\"` as the only traversed property. This is something we may consider enforcing in a future version of Core. This doesn’t mean you can’t use dynamic properties on collections, but it does avoid dynamically attaching geometry.\\n\\n[#](#using-the-traversal-functions)\\n Using the Traversal Functions\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor most use cases, the `DefaultTraversal` function can be used out of the box to consume Speckle objects individually while still retaining the object hierarchy (tree).\\n\\nThe below case demonstrates the `DefaultTraversal` implementation and how it can be used to iterate through the Tree. The `TraversalContext` objects are the tree nodes that contain the `current: Base` object and the `parent : TraveralContext`. Additionally, they contain the name of the parent’s property that was traversed to get to current.\\n\\n    async Task Foo(string myStream, ISpeckleConverter myConverter)\\n    {\\n        // Initialize traversal function with the given converter\\n        var traversalFunc = DefaultTraversal.CreateTraverseFunc(myConverter);\\n    \\n        // Receive commit object from the stream\\n        Base commitObject = await Helpers.Receive(myStream);\\n    \\n        // Traverse the commit object\\n        foreach (TraversalContext context in traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject))\\n        {\\n            // Get the current object in traversal\\n            Base current = context.current;\\n    \\n            // Get the parent of the current object\\n            TraversalContext? parent = context.parent;\\n    \\n            // Perform some operation on the current object\\n            // Replace `DoWork` with your actual functionality\\n            DoWork(current);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n\\nThe above code can be adapted to perform common tasks, such as\\n\\n*   Filter for walls\\n\\n    List<Wall> walls = traversalFunc.Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .OfType<Wall>()\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n\\n*   Filter for all objects by volume\\n\\n    List<Base> smallThings = traversalFunc\\n          .Traverse(commitObject)\\n          .Select(c => c.current)\\n          .Where(b => b[\"Volume\"] is double and < 20)\\n          .ToList();\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n[#](#the-traversal-rule-builder)\\n The Traversal Rule Builder\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBefore we delve into customizing traversal rules, let\\'s establish the default rules that are applied during traversal:\\n\\n**Default Traversal Rules:**\\n\\n1.  For Convertible Objects: Only the \"elements\" and its alias \"@elements\" properties are traversed.\\n2.  For Non-Convertible Objects: All properties are traversed, with no exceptions.\\n3.  For Collections: The \"elements\" property is the only one traversed, to avoid inconsistent behavior.\\n\\nNow that we understand the default behavior, let\\'s explore how you can create custom rules using the Traversal Rule Builder. The `TraversalRule` builder provides a means to construct a set of rules for how Speckle objects should be traversed. Each rule defines which properties of a Speckle object should be traversed and predicate criteria for when the rule is active for a given Speckle object.\\n\\n`GraphTraversal.Traverse(Base)` will perform a depth-first traversal of the provided commit object, adding objects into an internal stack. Rules are executed in order for the current `Base` object. The first rule, whose predicated function holds true, determines which members of said `Base` object are traversed (added to the stack).\\n\\nThe `DefaultTraversal` contains two simple rules. A rule is triggered for convertible objects (objects either convertible directly through the converter or through the existence of a `displayValue` property). For these objects, we only traverse `\"elements\"` (and `\"@elements\"`).\\n\\nThe second rule, the default rule, is used for all other objects (i.e. non-convertible objects); it traverses all properties on an object (with the exception of `Obsolete` and `SchemaIgnore` members)\\n\\n    // Implementation of the default traversal function, simplified for brevity\\n    public static GraphTraversal CreateTraverseFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n    {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(converter.CanConvertToNative) //NOTE: only one `When` clause needs to evaluate true, for this rule to hold true \\n            .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n            .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n            .When(_ => true) //Always evaluates true\\n            .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers); //AllMembers returns all non-obsolete members (instance & dynamic)\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, defaultRule);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nInside the `DefaultTraversal` class, you will find another traversal function returned by `CreateRevitTraversalFunc`. This function is almost the same as the regular function. However, instead of performing a deep traversal of nested elements. Instead, it halts traversal as soon as it finds a convertible object. Deeper traversal is then performed by the Revit converter, which has more control over the hosting of nested Revit Elements.\\n\\n      public static GraphTraversal CreateRevitTraversalFunc(ISpeckleConverter converter)\\n      {\\n        var convertibleRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(converter.CanConvertToNative)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(None);\\n    \\n        var displayValueRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(HasDisplayValue)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(ElementsAliases);\\n    \\n        var defaultRule = TraversalRule.NewTraversalRule()\\n          .When(_ => true)\\n          .ContinueTraversing(AllMembers);\\n    \\n        return new GraphTraversal(convertibleRule, displayValueRule, defaultRule);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-don-t-use-a-converter)\\n What if I Don’t Use a Converter?\\n\\nThese functions were designed for Speckle connectors, which by design, do not reference the `Objects` assembly. Because of this, the functions are unaware of the specific object models designed to be convertible. Thus we use the `ISpeckleConverter` interface to avoid coupling of converter and connector code projects.\\n\\nHowever, other use cases may require consuming Speckle data outside of a connector/converter’s software architecture. Fear not! the traversal functions are flexible in achieving desirable behaviour. Adapting the `CreateTraverseFunction` function or engineering custom rules to achieve the desired result is possible.\\n\\nAs a quick workaround, you could substitute the `converter.CanConvertToNative` function with a simple `b => b.speckle_type.contains(\"Objects.Geometry\")`. This should handle raw geometry, and the `HasDisplayValue` predicate should handle all other types of convertible geometry. This should give you similar results to our converter’s, though there may be some edge cases where this behaves differently.\\n\\n### [#](#what-if-i-want-custom-traversal-behaviour)\\n What if I Want Custom Traversal Behaviour?\\n\\nThe `TraverseRule` builder can be used to create **custom rules** and custom traversal behaviour.

It includes geometry and element base classes as well as conversions routines for the AEC applications that we officially support. Objects uses .NET Standard 2.0 and has been tested on Windows and MacOS. You can find the code in [speckle-sharp/Objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nObjects is available on NuGet as `Speckle.Objects`. All converters are also available under `Speckle.Objects.COnverter.*`.\\n\\nWhile the Objects is the default kit, you are free to develop your own kit or fork this one to customise it yourself. As of the beta release, easy swapping of kits within the connectors is not fully supported. However, this will be fully supported by the time we officially ship 2.0 🎉\\n\\nMore info on Objects and kits in 2.0 can be found in our [kits section](/dev/kits)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#developing)\\n Developing\\n----------------------------\\n\\nObjects kit is just a set of simple data transfer objects that are fairly straightforward to understand. The object model is split into two main parts:\\n\\n*   `Geometry`: the basic building blocks such as points, lines, meshes, surfaces, etc\\n*   `BuiltElements`: higher level elements such as rooms, beams, ducts, openings, topography, etc\\n\\n### [#](#writing-objects)\\n Writing Objects\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to contribute more [objects (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects)\\n to the Objects kit or extend and customise the kit yourself, you can easily do so by creating new classes that inherit from `Base`. You can read more about the `Base` class [here](/dev/base)\\n. There are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nThe class itself needs to have an empty constructor for serialisation / deserialisation purposes. You can create as many additional constructors for your own use as makes sense.\\n\\nFor example, here is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n### [#](#specific-host-application-support)\\n Specific Host Application Support\\n\\nThe basic objects are intended to be as general as possible\\n\\nIn order to better support interop between the various AEC host applications and Speckle, Objects also contains classes that help to deal with native object types and their properties. These inherit from a more generic Speckle object but add additional properties that are important for specific applications, but are too specific to include in the generic object.\\n\\nFor example, [`Objects.BuiltElements.Revit` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Objects/BuiltElements/Revit)\\n contains a collection of classes that extend the basic ones with a series of default Revit properties. This is the approach we\\'ll follow with other host applications as well.\\n\\n#### [#](#adding-schema-information-attributes-to-classes)\\n Adding Schema Information Attributes to Classes\\n\\nIn order for these _Host Application specific_ classes to be discoverable in any other host application (such as Grasshopper\\'s `Create Schema Object` node), this objects must contain at least one constructor with the attribute `SchemaInfo`. The attribute allows to provide human-readable names and descriptions that will be used to display to the user.\\n\\nIn addition, you can optionally add the `SchemaMainParam` attribute to one of the constructor\\'s inputs to signal it as the **main geometry parameter** for that Schema.\\n\\nHere\\'s the code for the `Objects.BuiltElements.Beam` constructor, with the `baseLine` flagged as its main parameter:\\n\\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\n#### [#](#handing-breaking-changes-in-the-schema-model)\\n Handing Breaking Changes in the Schema Model\\n\\nThese information from the `SchemaInfo` attribute is used, among other places, to automatically generate all the Schema Nodes you\\'ll find in the Grasshopper Connector.\\n\\nThis means that any breaking-change on that object will have unwanted side-effects on the end-user; such as previously existing Schemas dissapearing without warning.\\n\\nIn order to prevent this, the recommended way to update is to:\\n\\n1.  Add a `SchemaDeprecated` attribute to the existing constructor, and modify it\\'s implementation if necessary.\\n2.  Create a new constructor with the new parameters and add the `SchemaInfo` attribute to it too.\\n\\nFollowing our previous `Beam` example. If we added two new properties to our beam (`width` and `height`), the final changes would look like this:\\n\\n    public double width;\\n    public double height;\\n    \\n    [SchemaDeprecated, SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = 1.0;\\n        this.width = 1.0;\\n    }\\n    \\n    [SchemaInfo(\"Beam\", \"Creates a Speckle beam\", \"BIM\", \"Structure\")]\\n    public Beam([SchemaMainParam] ICurve baseLine, double height, double width)\\n    {\\n        this.baseLine = baseLine;\\n        this.height = height;\\n        this.width = width;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nThis will ensure that anyone using the previous Schema definition can still do, but also provide a way to notify them that they should upgrade to the new/upgraded one.\\n\\n> These `SchemaDeprecated` constructors will eventually be deleted from the object model, but not before giving all users enough warning.\\n\\n### [#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n\\nThe Objects kit doesn\\'t just stop at Objects - you need converters as well! These can be found in [Objects/Converters (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n. Each converter is a class within the `Objects.Converter` namespace and contains conversion routines to a Speckle object and to the native software equivalent. The two key methods within a converter are predictably:\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nBoth of these core methods check if the specific type passed into it is supported by the converter, then calls the conversion method for that type accordingly.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nEach supported type has its own conversion routines. You can expand the support of a converter by adding your own conversions. Depending on the converter structure, you can do this by either adding a new partial class (Revit) or adding to the respective `ConverterX.Geometry` or `ConverterX.BuiltElements` file (RhinoGh, Dynamo, AutoCAD). As a simple example, here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#instances-transforms-and-definitions)\\n Instances, Transforms, and Definitions\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle supports object instancing across many connectors, using an abstract `Objects` class that allows for conversions between block instances in Rhino and AutoCAD, family instances in Revit, collections and geometry instances in Blender, instances in Sketchup, and more.\\n\\nWhat is an instance?\\n\\nIn Speckle, an **instance** is a single **transformation** of a detached, typed **definition** object containing _transformable geometry_.\\n\\n### [#](#instances)\\n Instances\\n\\nCheck out the [Instance class in speckle-sharp (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/main/Objects/Objects/Other/Instance.cs)\\n.\\n\\nSpeckle instances live in the `Objects.Other` namespace and are comprised of two main parts:\\n\\n1.  A detached `definition` object, which contains transformable geometry including other instances.\\n2.  A `transform` matrix indicating the transformations to be applied to the geometry inside the definition.\\n\\nConcretions of the `Instance` class can contain instance-specific properties outside of the shared definition. When scoping your own concretion, keep in mind that any properties which will be shared across instances of the same definition should belong in the `definition` class, and any properties which are specific to a single instance should be on the `Instance` class.\\n\\n**What about receiving Instances in applications that do not support instancing?**\\n\\nOur abstract `Instance` class also contains virtual `GetTransformableGeometry()` and `GetTransformedGeometry()` methods which should be overridden in concretions.

As mentioned in [this page](/dev/kits)\\n, kits are made of:\\n\\n*   an object model\\n*   a set of converters\\n\\nA good example is the Objects kit, in our [speckle-sharp repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects)\\n.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nKit selection is not yet available in most of our connectors. We are planning to add it soon!\\n\\n[#](#object-model)\\n Object Model\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAn Object Model is just a collection _data structures_. These are the types that the kit is supporting, and for which conversion routines need to be written so that you can send and receive from Speckle.\\n\\n### [#](#creating-an-object-model)\\n Creating an Object Model\\n\\nThere are a few general rules to keep in mind when writing these classes.\\n\\n#### [#](#_1-always-inherit-from-the-base-class)\\n 1. Always Inherit from the `Base` Class\\n\\nThis ensures serialisation and deserialisation happen through Speckle, with the default sane serialisation handling that we know we can support. Most importantly, it will enable type name handling and cross-kit legibility. For more on the `Base` class, head to the [Base Object](/dev/base)\\n section.\\n\\n#### [#](#_2-reference-loops-will-be-ignored)\\n 2. Reference Loops will be Ignored\\n\\nYou can always recreate them post deserialisation using a function flagged with the `[OnDeserialized]` attribute like so:\\n\\n      [OnDeserialized]\\n      internal void onDeserialized(StreamingContext context)\\n      {\\n        Edges.ForEach(e => e.Brep = this);\\n        Loops.ForEach(l => l.Brep = this);\\n        Trims.ForEach(t => t.Brep = this);\\n        Faces.ForEach(f => f.Brep = this);\\n      }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n#### [#](#_3-keep-data-structures-lean)\\n 3. Keep Data Structures Lean\\n\\nYou should prefer typed arrays over lists of non-primitive values. For example, instead of a `List<Point>` for keeping track of mesh vertices, use a `List<double>`\\n\\n#### [#](#_4-always-include-a-parameterless-constructor)\\n 4. Always Include a Parameterless Constructor\\n\\nThis is for Newtonsoft serialisation / deserialisation. At worst, flag one constructor with the `[JsonConstructor]` attribute. Keep in mind this does indirect magic that can potentially trip you up - eg key names must match argument prop names.\\n\\n### [#](#example)\\n Example\\n\\nWith these rules in mind, creating your own classes by inheriting from `Base` is relatively straight forward. Additionally, there are also a few [interfaces (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Interfaces.cs)\\n an object can inherit from including `ICurve`, `IHasArea`, `IHasVolume`, and `IHasBoundingBox`.\\n\\nFor a simple example, this is what our [box class (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Objects/Geometry/Box.cs)\\n looks like:\\n\\n    public class Box : Base, IHasVolume, IHasArea, IHasBoundingBox\\n    {\\n      public Plane basePlane { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval xSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval ySize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Interval zSize { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box bbox { get; }\\n    \\n      public double area { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public double volume { get; set; }\\n    \\n      public Box() { }\\n    \\n      public Box(Plane basePlane, Interval xSize, Interval ySize, Interval zSize, string units = Units.Meters, string applicationId = null)\\n      {\\n        this.basePlane = basePlane;\\n        this.xSize = xSize;\\n        this.ySize = ySize;\\n        this.zSize = zSize;\\n        this.applicationId = applicationId;\\n        this.units = units;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n\\n[#](#converters)\\n Converters\\n----------------------------\\n\\nConverters are the key to interoperability. They include the conversion routines for objects to and from the object model types. You create a new converter for each different application you want to support by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleConverter` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleConverter.cs)\\n. All your converters should live together in the same kit alongside your types. You can see how we\\'ve implemented converters in our default Objects kit [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Objects/Converters)\\n.\\n\\nConverters exist in the `MyKit.Converter` namespace and can either be broken up into smaller partial classes for each supported type (see the Revit Converter) or for each category (eg `ConverterX.Geometry` and `ConverterX.BuiltElements` as in the rest of our converters).\\n\\nThe converters must implement two key methods (plus a few others not described here):\\n\\n*   `ConvertToNative`: converts a Speckle object to the native software\\n*   `ConvertToSpeckle`: converts a native software object to Speckle\\n\\nThe specific conversion routines for each supported type are defined separately and called from these key methods. If the type is not supported, an error should be added to the converter\\'s `ConversionErrors` and a null object should be returned.\\n\\nFor example, here is a shortened version of the [`ConvertToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/ConverterRevit.cs#L69-L154)\\n method in `ConverterRevit`:\\n\\n    public Base ConvertToSpeckle(object @object)\\n    {\\n      Base returnObject = null;\\n      switch (@object)\\n      {\\n        case DB.DetailCurve o:\\n          returnObject = DetailCurveToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.DirectShape o:\\n          returnObject = DirectShapeToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.FamilyInstance o:\\n          returnObject = FamilyInstanceToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        case DB.Floor o:\\n          returnObject = FloorToSpeckle(o);\\n          break;\\n        // etc ...\\n        default:\\n          ConversionErrors.Add(new Error(\"Type not supported\", $\"Cannot convert {@object.GetType()} to Speckle\"));\\n          returnObject = null;\\n          break;\\n      }\\n    \\n      return returnObject;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n\\nAnd here is the Revit [`BeamToSpeckle` (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/9ba30e125f2bd65d2f746563d00a90a736ade116/Objects/Converters/ConverterRevit/ConverterRevitShared/Partial%20Classes/ConvertBeam.cs#L93-L111)\\n method which is called by the `FamilyInstanceToSpeckle` conversion:\\n\\n    private RevitBeam BeamToSpeckle(DB.FamilyInstance revitBeam)\\n    {\\n      var baseGeometry = LocationToSpeckle(revitBeam);\\n      var baseLine = baseGeometry as ICurve;\\n      if (baseLine == null)\\n      {\\n        throw new Exception(\"Only line based Beams are currently supported.\");\\n      }\\n    \\n      var speckleBeam = new RevitBeam();\\n      speckleBeam.type = Doc.GetElement(revitBeam.GetTypeId()).Name;\\n      speckleBeam.baseLine = baseLine;\\n      speckleBeam.level = ConvertAndCacheLevel(revitBeam, BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_REFERENCE_LEVEL_PARAM);\\n      speckleBeam[\"@displayMesh\"] = GetElementMesh(revitBeam);\\n    \\n      GetAllRevitParamsAndIds(speckleBeam, revitBeam);\\n    \\n      return speckleBeam;\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kit-interface)\\n Kit Interface\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got your object model and your conversion routines, you can officially put together your kit by inheriting from the [`ISpeckleKit` interface (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/blob/master/Core/Core/Kits/ISpeckleKit.cs)\\n and register your `Types` and `Converters`.\\n\\n    public interface ISpeckleKit\\n    {\\n      IEnumerable<Type> Types { get; }\\n    \\n      IEnumerable<string> Converters { get; }\\n    \\n      string Description { get; }\\n      string Name { get; }\\n      string Author { get; }\\n      string WebsiteOrEmail { get; }\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Tries to load a converter for a specific app.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"app\">Must be one of the Kits.Applications variables.</param>\\n      /// <returns>The converter for the specific app, or null.</returns>\\n      public ISpeckleConverter LoadConverter(string app);\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#kitmanager)\\n KitManager\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe KitManager is a handy tool for loading up different kits.

This allows you, as a developer, to even use Speckle \"without Speckle\".\\n\\nWe currently have a couple of transports scaffolded:\\n\\n*   in memory\\n*   sqlite\\n*   disk\\n*   remote (speckle server)\\n*   mongodb (experimental)\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nTransports are available on NuGet as `Speckle.Transports.*`.\\n\\nWhy are transports really cool? Imagine you want to write your own server, from scratch. To use it in all our connectors, the only thing you need to do is write a transport that uses your server\\'s api!\\n\\nAnother use case would be if you want to simultaneously send your data to a MySQL database. We currently do not support this, but using a custom built transport, you can send your data to it, at the same time as sending it to a Speckle server.\\n\\nIMPORTANT 🙌\\n\\nWhere are all the transports?\\n\\n*   Required ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Core/Transports)\\n     (in-memory, sqlite)\\n*   Extraneous ones are [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp/tree/master/Core/Transports)\\n     (Server, Disk, MongoDB)\\n\\nHere\\'s how the `ITransport` interface looks like. Beware, it will be cleaned up in the near future!\\n\\n    public interface ITransport\\n    {\\n      public string TransportName { get; set; }\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Saves an object.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"id\">The hash of the object.</param>\\n      /// <param name=\"serializedObject\">The full string representation of the object.</param>\\n      public void SaveObject(string id, string serializedObject);\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Saves an object, retrieving its serialised version from the provided transport.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"id\">The hash of the object.</param>\\n      /// <param name=\"sourceTransport\">The transport from where to retrieve it.</param>\\n      public void SaveObject(string id, ITransport sourceTransport);\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Gets an object.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"id\">The object\\'s hash.</param>\\n      public string GetObject(string id);\\n    \\n      /// <summary>\\n      /// Copies the parent object and all its children to the provided transport.\\n      /// </summary>\\n      /// <param name=\"id\">The id of the object you want to copy.</param>\\n      /// <param name=\"targetTransport\">The transport you want to copy the object to.</param>\\n      public Task<string> CopyObjectAndChildren(string id, ITransport targetTransport);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/transports-dev.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 8/1/2021, 10:56:30 AM\\n\\n← [Writing your own kit](/dev/kits-dev.html) [Introduction](/dev/python.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",

However, it is not comprehensive. For more examples, please explore the repo\\'s [tests (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-py/tree/main/tests)\\n.\\n\\n[#](#sending-and-receiving)\\n Sending and Receiving\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLet\\'s look at how to send an object to a stream on your server and then receive that object back.\\n\\nFirst, you\\'ll need to create and authenticate a client. To use the client, you\\'ll need access to a Speckle server. To authenticate the client, you\\'ll either need local accounts (added using [Manager](/user/manager)\\n), or you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    \\n    # initialise the client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=\"your-server.com\") # or whatever your host is\\n    # client = SpeckleClient(host=\"localhost:3000\", use_ssl=False) or use local server\\n    \\n    # authenticate the client with a token\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # if you\\'re in an environment without accounts, you can construct an Account object yourself\\n    # or authenticate with just a token\\n    # client.authenticate_with_token(\"YOUR_TOKEN\")\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n\\nNow that you have an authenticated client, you can start interacting with the API. Let\\'s create a new stream and get that stream back.\\n\\n    # create a new stream. this returns the stream id\\n    new_stream_id = client.stream.create(name=\"a shiny new stream\")\\n    \\n    # use that stream id to get the stream from the server\\n    new_stream = client.stream.get(id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n\\nNext, we\\'ll need some data to send. Let\\'s extend `Base` to create a simple block to make it more interesting. All your custom objects should inherit from `Base` to ensure that serialization will work as expected.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point\\n    \\n    class Block(Base):\\n        length: float\\n        width: float\\n        height: float\\n        origin: Point = None\\n    \\n        def __init__(self, length=1.0, width=1.0, height=1.0, origin=Point(), **kwargs) -> None:\\n            super().__init__(**kwargs)\\n            # mark the origin as a detachable attribute\\n            self.add_detachable_attrs({\"origin\"})\\n    \\n            self.length = length\\n            self.width = width\\n            self.height = height\\n            self.origin = origin\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNow let\\'s send a block to the server! To do this, you\\'ll first need to send the object to the stream and get back the object id or hash. You can then use this to create a commit on the stream that references this object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    \\n    # here\\'s the data you want to send\\n    block = Block(length=2, height=4)\\n    \\n    # next create a server transport - this is the vehicle through which you will send and receive\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=new_stream_id)\\n    \\n    # this serialises the block and sends it to the transport\\n    hash = operations.send(base=block, transports=[transport])\\n    \\n    # you can now create a commit on your stream with this object\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        stream_id=new_stream_id, \\n        object_id=hash, \\n        message=\"this is a block I made in speckle-py\",\\n        )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nTada! You should now have a commit on your stream containing your block. You\\'ll be able to see the commit on the stream page on the web. Receiving an object back is pretty similar to receiving it. You\\'ll generally be using the client to get a commit, then getting the hash to receive from the `referencedObject` attribute on that commit.\\n\\n    # this receives the object back from the transport.\\n    # the received data will be deserialised back into a `Block` \\n    received_base = operations.receive(obj_id=hash, remote_transport=transport)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n### [#](#short-hand-the-stream-wrapper)\\n Short Hand: The Stream Wrapper\\n\\nYou\\'ve just seen how to simply send and receive objects using the `SpeckleClient` and a `ServerTransport`. Since v2.2.6, you can use a handy helper to get a client and a transport from a stream URL - the `StreamWrapper`!\\n\\nThe `StreamWrapper` can parse any URL pointing to a stream, branch, commit, object, or globals. If you have a local account for the stream you provided, you can get an authenticated client and transport using the helper methods:\\n\\n    from specklepy.api.wrapper import StreamWrapper\\n    \\n    # provide any stream, branch, commit, object, or globals url\\n    wrapper = StreamWrapper(\"https://speckle.xyz/streams/3073b96e86/commits/604bea8cc6\")\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated SpeckleClient if you have a local account for the server\\n    client = wrapper.get_client()\\n    \\n    # get an authenticated ServerTransport if you have a local account for the server\\n    transport = wrapper.get_transport()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#overview-of-functionality)\\n Overview of Functionality\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### [#](#graphql-client)\\n GraphQL Client\\n\\nThe `SpeckleClient` is the entry point for interacting with the GraphQL API.

You will need to provide a `transport` to indicate where the objects should be sent to/received from. When sending, you can provide multiple transports to send the same object to multiple places simultaneously. Currently, we have three types of \\'transport\\': `SQLiteTransport`, `MemoryTransport`, and `ServerTransport`.

However, note that this method will not recompose a base and will only get the object you explicitly ask for using by its id.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.serialization.base_object_serializer import BaseObjectSerializer\\n    \\n    # create a test base object\\n    test_base = Base()\\n    test_base.testing = \"a test base obj\"\\n    \\n    # run it through the serialiser\\n    s = BaseObjectSerializer()\\n    hash, obj = s.traverse_base(test_base)\\n    \\n    # send it to the server\\n    objCreate = client.object.create(stream_id=\"stream id\", objects=[obj])\\n    \\n    received_base = client.object.get(\"stream id\", hash)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\n### [#](#base-object-and-serialization)\\n Base Object and Serialization\\n\\n#### [#](#the-base-object)\\n The Base Object\\n\\nThe `Base` class is the one you\\'re familiar with from the rest of the Speckle universe. It generally behaves the same way as it does in the other SDKs. For more info about the `Base` object, have a look [here](/dev/base)\\n.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # creating a base we will nest within a parent base\\n    detached_base = Base()\\n    detached_base.name = \"a detached base\"\\n    \\n    # creating our parent base object\\n    base_obj = Base()\\n    \\n    # attributes can be added using dot or dict notation\\n    base_obj.name = \"my base\"\\n    base_obj[\"colour\"] = \"lilac\"\\n    \\n    # other base objects can be nested within.\\n    # prepending the attribute name with `@` will detach the nested base when sending\\n    base_obj[\"@nested\"] = detached_base\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n\\nThe `Base` class has a few handy instance methods for identifying your object\\'s typed and dynamic attributes:\\n\\n*   `get_typed_member_names()` gets all of the names of the defined (typed) attributes of the object\\n*   `get_dynamic_member_names()` gets all of the names of the dynamic attributes of the object\\n*   `get_member_names()` gets a list of all the attributes on the object, dynamic or not\\n\\nEach `Base` object has an `id` (a unique hash) as it does in the other SDKs. This field is only populated if the `Base` has been previously serialized. If you _really_ need the hash, you can get it using the `get_id()` method. Be aware that this call will fully serialize the object to create the `id` if the `id` is not populated! By default, the hash will be generated without decomposing the object. However, you can pass `decompose=True` as an argument if you want the decomposed `id`.\\n\\n#### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nThe `Base` class can be subclassed to create your own custom objects. These are automatically added to a class-level registry, simply a dictionary with the type name as the key. The type is automatically populated by the `speckle_type` attribute but can be overwritten when writing your class.\\n\\nNote that all typed attributes of a class **must be initialized with a non-mutable default value** or a value that you will only change by reassignment. If you\\'d like mutable defaults, you should write an `__init__` method for the class to set these (see the `Block` example in the first section).\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from specklepy.objects.geometry import Point\\n    \\n    class Line(Base):\\n        start: Point = None\\n        end: Point = None\\n    \\n    class AlternativeLine(Base, speckle_type=\"Line_Two\"):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        The `speckle_type` is automatically populated by the class name.\\n        You can override this behaviour as demonstrated here.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        a: Point = None\\n        b: Point = None\\n    \\n    # look, a new custom line!\\n    line = Line(end=Point(x=1, y=0, z=2))\\n    \\n    # adding dynamic attributes as normal\\n    line.blah = \"blah\"\\n    line[\"colour\"] = \"blue\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nYou can also mark typed attributes as detachable or chunkable by updating the internal `_detachable` set or `_chunkable` dict with the provided helper methods.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    from typing import List\\n    \\n    # members that are chunked upon sending are stored in a dictionary\\n    # with the name as the key and the maximum chunk size as the value\\n    CHUNKABLE_PROPS = {\\n        \"vertices\": 1000,\\n        \"faces\": 100,\\n        \"colors\": 100,\\n        \"textureCoordinates\": 100,\\n        \"test_bases\": 10,\\n    }\\n    \\n    # detachable members are just added to an internal set by name\\n    DETACHABLE = {\"detach_this\", \"origin\"}\\n    \\n    # you can pass a chunkables dict and a detachables as keyword arguments when writing your class\\n    class FakeMesh(Base, chunkable=CHUNKABLE_PROPS, detachable=DETACHABLE):\\n        vertices: List[float] = None\\n        faces: List[int] = None\\n        colors: List[int] = None\\n        textureCoordinates: List[float] = None\\n        test_bases: List[Base] = None\\n        detach_this: Base = None\\n        _origin: Point = None\\n    \\n        # properties are also picked up and serialised as you\\'d expect\\n        @property\\n        def origin(self):\\n            return self._origin\\n    \\n        @origin.setter\\n        def origin(self, value: Point):\\n            self._origin = value\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n\\n#### [#](#serialization)\\n Serialization\\n\\nThe `BaseObjectSerializer` is used behind the scenes in the `operations` for decomposing and serializing `Base` objects so they can be sent/received to the server.

As a refresher, you\\'ll need to create a `SpeckleClient` which serves as your entry point to the API. We then authenticate this client using a token from a local account. If you haven\\'t used the [Manager](/user/manager)\\n to add a local account, you can go to `your-server.com/profile` and create a Personal Access Token to use here. We\\'ll then use this client to get the commit we\\'re interested in.\\n\\nIn this case, we\\'re going to be looking at this twisty building Alan generated in Grasshopper and send to Speckle using the [Grasshopper Connector](/user/grasshopper)\\n. It has 10 levels split into separate objects each containing fields for facades, columns, banisters, and floor slabs.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-gh-commit.4e610fcb.gif)\\n\\nThe snippet below shows how you would authenticate the client, get the commit we\\'re interested in, and use a server transport to receive the commit object.\\n\\n    from specklepy.api import operations\\n    from specklepy.api.client import SpeckleClient\\n    from specklepy.api.credentials import get_default_account\\n    from specklepy.transports.server import ServerTransport\\n    \\n    # create and authenticate a client\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    # get the specified commit data\\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    # create an authenticated server transport from the client and receive the commit obj\\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n\\n[#](#update-existing-objects)\\n Update Existing Objects\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve received this building from Grasshopper, let\\'s make some modifications.

However, currently no material information has been added to the elements in the stream. We can add this ourselves and update the stream for the rest of the team.\\n\\n### [#](#subclassing-base)\\n Subclassing Base\\n\\nTo do this, let\\'s create classes for each material and add these materials to a \"material\" attribute on each object within the stream. Obviously, this is a bit of an over the top example. It would be more efficient to just add a string attribute to each object that indicates the material, then look up the material properties from a database when running the calculations. However, I want to have some fun here and show you some of the cool things you can do with the `Base` class!\\n\\nLet\\'s start with defining our materials as `Base` subclasses. This ensures they\\'ll be serialised correctly and that they\\'ll be picked up by the `Base` type registry. We can then create a mapping for each element type name to the `speckle_type` of the corresponding material class. The `speckle_type` is prepopulated by the class and defaults to the class name.\\n\\n    # density (kg/m^3) and embodied carbon (kg CO^2/kg) estimates\\n    # from https://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/embodied-energy/\\n    class Concrete(Base):\\n        density: str = 2400\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.159\\n    \\n    \\n    class Glass(Base):\\n        density: str = 2500\\n        embodied_carbon = 0.85\\n    \\n    \\n    class Steel(Base):\\n        density: str = 7800\\n        embodied_carbon = 1.37\\n    \\n    \\n    MATERIALS_MAPPING = {\\n        \"@floorSlab\": \"Concrete\",\\n        \"@banister\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@facade\": \"Glass\",\\n        \"@columns\": \"Steel\",\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nWe can now write a function that iterates through all the members of a level and adds a material if it exists in our mapping.\\n\\n    def add_materials_data(level: Base) -> Base:\\n        # first, get all the attribute names\\n        names = level.get_member_names()\\n        # then iterate through them to check if they exist in our mapping\\n        for name in names:\\n            if name not in MATERIALS_MAPPING.keys():\\n                break\\n            # if they do, use this class method to get the class and init it\\n            material = Base.get_registered_type(MATERIALS_MAPPING[name])()\\n            # now we can add a `@material` attribute dynamically to each object.\\n            # note that we\\'re making it detachable with the `@`\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                prop[\"@material\"] = material\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                for item in prop:\\n                    item[\"@material\"] = material\\n        return level\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n\\nNote that we\\'ve added a _detached_ dynamic attribute called `@material` to each element we are interested in. We\\'ve marked it as detachable (prepended with an `@`) so we don\\'t store hundreds of copies of the same materials classes in this stream. Each instance of each materials class in our case is the same, so we only need to store each once. However, we want to reference them within multiple elements. Using a detachable attribute is the solution! You get a reference for the correct material object in each element, but you only store unique objects (in our case, one instance of each material class) in the stream.\\n\\n### [#](#sending-to-the-stream)\\n Sending to the Stream\\n\\nWe can now use the `add_materials_data()` method we wrote to update all the levels in the stream and send these updated levels back. Let\\'s add on to what we\\'ve already written.\\n\\nTo send our updated building, we\\'ll need to create a parent `Base` and place our list of nested levels inside this parent. To keep things consistent, we\\'ll be adding them to a field called `data`.\\n\\n    from specklepy.objects import Base\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nWe\\'ll then use `operations.send()` to send this object to the stream, then use `client.commit.create()` to commit our changes to the stream. If we want to send to a new branch, we can do so by first creating one using `client.branch.create(stream_id, name, description)`. The snippet below shows this full process.\\n\\n    # recap from earlier\\n    client = SpeckleClient(host=HOST)\\n    account = get_default_account()\\n    client.authenticate_with_account(account)\\n    \\n    commit = client.commit.get(STREAM_ID, COMMIT_ID)\\n    \\n    transport = ServerTransport(client=client, stream_id=STREAM_ID)\\n    res = operations.receive(commit.referencedObject, transport)\\n    \\n    # get the list of levels from the received object\\n    levels = res[\"data\"]\\n    \\n    # add the materials data to our levels\\n    levels = [add_materials_data(level) for level in levels]\\n    \\n    # create a branch if you\\'d like\\n    branch_name = \"🐍 demo\"\\n    branches = client.branch.list(STREAM_ID)\\n    has_res_branch = any(b.name == branch_name for b in branches)\\n    if not has_res_branch:\\n        client.branch.create(\\n            STREAM_ID, name=branch_name, description=\"new stuff from py\"\\n        )\\n    \\n    # create a base object to hold the list of levels\\n    base = Base(data=levels)\\n    # and send the data to the server and get back the hash of the object\\n    obj_id = operations.send(base, [transport])\\n    \\n    # now create a commit on that branch with your updated data!\\n    commid_id = client.commit.create(\\n        STREAM_ID,\\n        obj_id,\\n        branch_name,\\n        message=\"add detached materials\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n30  \\n31  \\n32  \\n33  \\n34  \\n35  \\n36  \\n37  \\n\\nIf we go back to the web to look at the stream, you\\'ll see your newest commit. The geometry should look the same since this hasn\\'t been modified, but stepping into the data will show you the new material attribute. As you can see in the gif below, the id of the `Concrete` object is the same on different floor slabs since the attribute is detached and the objects are identical.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/pysample-materials-data.dee7f66f.gif)\\n\\nNow that you\\'ve sent your changes to the server, anyone you\\'re collaborating with will also be able to pull down your changes and use these updated elements with materials data!\\n\\n[#](#do-cool-stuff)\\n Do Cool Stuff\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWe\\'ve now seen how we can receive, work with, and send data from Python just like you can with any of the other SDKs and connectors. Great, now we can use that data to make something cool! Let\\'s plot the data using [plotly (opens new window)](https://plotly.com/python/)\\n and display it on a simple page using [dash (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n. I won\\'t go into too much detail on using the libraries themselves, but most of the plotting code has just been modified from the boilerplate and examples in their docs.\\n\\nTo start, let\\'s extract some existing data from the objects and plot them. Each geometry object we\\'re interested in has a `Vertices` attribute containing a list of points. Let\\'s plot the vertices of the floor slabs and columns on a 3D scatter plot. To do this, we\\'ll need to construct a pandas data frame with the values we are interested in by iterating through the levels.\\n\\n    import pandas as pd\\n    \\n    def construct_points_df(levels: List[Base]):\\n        # initialise a pandas data frame\\n        df_vertices = pd.DataFrame(columns=(\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"element\"))\\n    \\n        vertices = []\\n        for level in levels:\\n            # add column vertices\\n            columns = level[\"@columns\"]\\n            for column in columns:\\n                points = column.Vertices\\n                for p in points:\\n                    vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"columns\"})\\n            # add floor slab vertices\\n            floorslab = level[\"@floorSlab\"]\\n            points = floorslab.Vertices\\n            for p in points:\\n                vertices.append({\"x\": p.x, \"y\": p.y, \"z\": p.z, \"element\": \"floorSlab\"})\\n    \\n        return df_vertices.append(vertices)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n\\nNow we can just pass that data frame into the plotly express `scatter_3d` method and `show()` the figure.\\n\\n    import plotly.express as px\\n    \\n    df_vertices = construct_points_df(levels)\\n    \\n    fig = px.scatter_3d(\\n        df_vertices,\\n        x=\"x\",\\n        y=\"y\",\\n        z=\"z\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        opacity=0.7,\\n        title=\"Element Vertices (m)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    fig.show()\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n\\nPlotly plots have interactivity built in, so this is all the code we need to produce this 3D scatter plot.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VGcrHPB.gif)\\n\\nNext, let\\'s make use of the material properties we added to each of the stream objects. Let\\'s calculate the mass and embodied carbon for each element type in one level and construct a data frame with the results.\\n\\n    def construct_carbon_df(level: Base):\\n        data = {\"element\": [], \"volume\": [], \"mass\": [], \"embodied carbon\": []}\\n    \\n        # get the attributes on the level object\\n        names = level.get_dynamic_member_names()\\n        # iterate through and find the elements with a `volume` attribute\\n        for name in names:\\n            prop = level[name]\\n            if isinstance(prop, Base):\\n                if not hasattr(prop, \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                # if it has a volume, use the material attribute to calculated\\n                # the embodied carbon\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(prop.volume)\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            elif isinstance(prop, list):\\n                if not hasattr(prop[0], \"volume\"):\\n                    break\\n                data[\"volume\"].append(sum(p.volume for p in prop))\\n                data[\"mass\"].append(data[\"volume\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].density)\\n                data[\"embodied carbon\"].append(\\n                    data[\"mass\"][-1] * prop[0][\"@material\"].embodied_carbon\\n                )\\n            data[\"element\"].append(name[1:]) # removing the prepending `@`\\n    \\n        return pd.DataFrame(data)\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nUsing this data frame, we can use the plotly express `pie()` and `bar()` methods to create some lovely plots.\\n\\n    # take the first level from our levels list and construct a data frame\\n    df_carbon = construct_carbon_df(levels[0])\\n    \\n    # let\\'s add them all to a dict to keep the together\\n    figures = {}\\n    \\n    figures[\"volumes\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"volume\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Volumes of Elements Per Floor (m3)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon bar\"] = px.bar(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        x=\"element\",\\n        y=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n    figures[\"carbon pie\"] = px.pie(\\n        df_carbon,\\n        values=\"embodied carbon\",\\n        names=\"element\",\\n        color=\"element\",\\n        title=\"Embodied Carbon Per Floor (kgC02)\",\\n    )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n25  \\n26  \\n27  \\n28  \\n29  \\n\\nThe last thing we\\'re going to do is add the figures to a dash app. To do this, we are simply taking the boilerplate [dash layout (opens new window)](https://dash.plotly.com/layout)\\n, replacing the sample figure with our own figures, and adding some custom css in `/assets/style.css`.\\n\\n// Make sure to add code blocks to your code group\\n\\nNow all that\\'s left is to run `app.py` and head to [`http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (opens new window)](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)\\n to see your amazing plots.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ELzd1NG.gif)\\n\\n[#](#conclusion)\\n Conclusion\\n----------------------------\\n\\nAnd voila - you\\'ve created the basis for a dashboard powered by your Speckle data!

The property information provided is:\\n\\n*   `type` ( == `'string'` / `'number'` / `'boolean'`): the property type\\n*   `objectCount` (int): How many objects in the scene have this property\\n*   `allValues` (array of `objectCount` elements): The values for this property of all objects that have this property\\n*   `minValue` - the smallest value (using `<` operator, works also on strings)\\n*   `maxValue` - the largest value\\n*   `uniqueValues` - a dictionary of `{ uniqueValue: occurrenceCount }` elements, specifying how many objects have the property set to that specific value\\n\\n### [#](#filtering-and-colouring)\\n Filtering and Colouring\\n\\nThose calls filter and color the objects loaded in the scene, and drops the previous applied filters (filtering is not additive).\\n\\nSyntax: `await v.applyFilter( { filterBy, colorBy, ghostOthers } )`\\n\\nThe 3 optional parameters are:\\n\\n*   `filterBy`: A dictionary that specify the filter. Elements are in the form `{ propertyName: propertyValueFilter }`. The propertyValueFilter can be one of:\\n    \\n    *   A specific value: (only objects with that property value pass the filter)\\n    *   An array of values: An object passes the filter if its value is in the array\\n    *   A range of values, specified by `{ 'gte': value1, 'lte': value2 }` (greater than or equal, lower than or equal)\\n    *   An exclusion list, specified by `{ 'not': excludedValuesArray }`\\n*   `colorBy`: A dictionary that makes all objects colored based on a property value. Two types of coloring are supported:\\n    \\n    *   Gradient (from a numeric property): `{ 'type': 'gradient', 'property': propertyName, 'minValue': propertyMinValue, 'maxValue': propertyMaxValue, 'gradientColors': [color1, color2] }`\\n    *   Category (for coloring each unique value differently): `{ 'type': 'category', 'property': propertyName, 'values': { value1: color1, value2: color2, ... }, 'default': colorForAnyOtherValue }`. The `values` and the `default` parameters are optional: Random colors are generated if they are omitted.\\n*   `ghostOthers`: A boolean (default `false`). If set to `true`, then the objects that are filtered out are actually shown with very low opacity, so that the remaining objects have a better context.\\n    \\n\\nTo remove all filters: `await v.applyFilter( null )`\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n*   filter and color levels by name\\n\\n    v.applyFilter({filterBy: {'level.name': ['3FL', '4FL', '7FL']}, colorBy: { property: 'level.name', type: 'category', values: {'3FL': '#F0FFFF', '4FL': '#6495ED', '7FL': '#7B68EE'} }, ghostOthers: true } )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/image-20211206-viewer-filter-color.6da9da14.png)\\n\\n*   color by property (e.g. 'baseLine')\\n\\n    v.applyFilter({colorBy: { property: 'baseLine.start.x', type: 'gradient', minValue: -7200, maxValue: 33000, 'gradientColors': ['white', 'CornflowerBlue', 'BlueViolet'] } } )\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/image-20211206-viewer-color-gradient.f0397ef3.png)\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/js.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 3/2/2024, 9:21:11 PM\\n\\n← [Tutorial: Simple Dashboard](/dev/py-sample.html) [Using our Embeddable 3D Viewer](/dev/viewer.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)\",\n",

With just a few lines of code, you\\'ll be able to send, receive and leverage our API from Google Sheets, Docs etc.\\n\\nHere\\'s a few examples to get you started.\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nFirst of all we need to create a [Personal Access Token](/dev/tokens)\\n, make sure to select the scopes that you\\'ll need for running your queries and mutations. As always, treat this token as a password!\\n\\n[#](#writing-your-queries)\\n Writing your Queries\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo learn how to write queries check out our section on the [Server API](/dev/server-api)\\n, and use the GraphQL explorer to make sure your query or mutation works as expected.\\n\\nNext, since App Scripts doesn\\'t have a GraphQL library we need to transform them a bit to work with `UrlFetchApp`, it\\'s just a matter of setting the right payload and parameters.\\n\\nHere\\'s what a function that runs a query to get the currently logged user looks like, remember to replace `YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS` and `YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN`. You can extend its fields to get the streams, branches and commits as well:\\n\\n    function getMe() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `query User {\\n                          user{\\n                            id,\\n                            email,\\n                            name\\n                          }\\n                        }`,\\n        variables: null,\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n24  \\n\\nTIP\\n\\nHow do you create a token, we hear you ask? Read the section on [personal access tokens](/dev/tokens.html)\\n!\\n\\nHere\\'s a function that runs a mutation to create a new stream:\\n\\n    function createStream() {\\n      let url = \"https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/graphql\";\\n      let graphql = JSON.stringify({\\n        query: `mutation streamCreate($myStream: StreamCreateInput!) { streamCreate(stream: $myStream) }`,\\n        variables: {\\n          myStream: {\\n            name: \"Sample Stream\",\\n            description: \"Created from Google Sheets!\",\\n          },\\n        },\\n      });\\n      let params = {\\n        method: \"POST\",\\n        payload: graphql,\\n        headers: {\\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\\n          Authorization: \"Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN\",\\n        },\\n      };\\n      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, params);\\n    \\n      Logger.log(response);\\n    }\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n11  \\n12  \\n13  \\n14  \\n15  \\n16  \\n17  \\n18  \\n19  \\n20  \\n21  \\n22  \\n23  \\n\\nThis is all!

You can then use this to trigger ci apps, automation workflows, and more! The world is your oyster. Let\\'s have a quick look at how to work with them.\\n\\n[#](#setting-up-a-stream-webhook)\\n Setting Up A Stream Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOn the sidebar of a stream, you\\'ll find a \"⚙ Settings\" button. Click this and head to the \"Webhooks\" tab to add webhooks to your stream.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126977638-67d2958c-12d2-40b2-aef3-da5a01451773.gif)\\n\\nThere are a few different fields to fill out when setting up a webhook:\\n\\n*   URL: The URL that will be sent `POST` requests when your webhook is triggered\\n*   Description: Optional identifying text (will be shown when viewing all your webhooks in a list)\\n*   Secret: An optional token that will help you verity that requests you receive are actually coming from the Speckle Server. Requests will be secured with an `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` which you can verify upon receiving.\\n*   Triggers: The events you want to trigger the webhook\\n*   Enabled: Toggle the webhook on and off\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126979041-ac01d1f7-e9d3-455c-ab4f-7154ab891a96.png)\\n\\nYou can of course also manage webhooks via the [GraphQL API](/dev/server-graphql-api)\\n using the `webhookCreate`, `webhookUpdate`, and `webhookDelete` mutations. There is a `webhooks` field on the `stream` schema which you can query to get the webhooks for a stream and the `history` of previous requests.\\n\\n[#](#receiving-the-webhook)\\n Receiving the Webhook\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen the condition defined in the webhook definition is met, a `POST` request will be made to the provided URL.\\n\\nThe POST request will contain 1 string parameter, called `payload`, that is the JSON representation of the webhook payload.\\n\\nImportant note on the JSON encoding\\n\\nThe way of passing the POST parameter is `application/json`, and the parameter is again encoded as JSON for compatibility with various frameworks that don\\'t handle nested json properties. So the actual POST request body might look something like:\\n\\n    {\"payload\":\"{\\\\\"streamId\\\\\":\\\\\"a35c7a8bdd\\\\\",\\\\\"userId\\\\\":\\\\\"bc4e472126\\\\\",\\\\\"activityMessage\\\\\":\\\\\"Stream metadata changed\\\\\", ...\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\nTo ensure that only the configured Speckle Server will successfully call your publicly available webhook server, there is the `X-WEBHOOK-SIGNATURE` header that can be used to validate the authenticity of the call. It is the sha256 HMAC on the payload json string, using the shared secret configured on the webhook. Example python code to validate the signature:\\n\\n    import hmac\\n    # ...\\n    \\n    expected_signature = hmac.new(SHARED_SECRET.encode(), payload_json.encode(), \\'sha256\\').hexdigest()\\n    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, SIGNATURE_FROM_HEADER):\\n        print(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n        return\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n\\nAnd javascript (node):\\n\\n    const * as crypto from \\'crypto\\'\\n    \\n    const secret = \\'YOUR_SECRET_HERE\\'\\n    const expectedSignature = crypto\\n        .createHmac(\\'sha256\\', secret)\\n        .update(request.body.payload)\\n        .digest(\\'hex\\')\\n    const signatureFromHeader = request.headers[\\'x-webhook-signature\\']\\n    \\n    if (signatureFromHeader != expectedSignature) response.status(401).send(\\'Ignoring request with invalid signature\\')\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n10  \\n\\n[#](#reporting-success)\\n Reporting Success\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe endpoint code should return a HTTP response status header. The server recognises statuses `200 OK` to `204 NO_CONTENT` as a successful execution. Alternatively, your endpoint can respond with other statuses in its execution. The webhook execution log shows these as error with additional payload data you supply to diagnose issues.\\n\\nGo back to the main \"Webhooks\" tab to view all the webhooks on the stream. Click on a webhook to open the edit menu. The symbol to the left to the description indicates the status of the last webhook request; hover over it to get more information. Here, the green ✔ indicates the last request was successfully sent. The grey circle with an ❕ indicates no requests have been sent yet (you\\'ve likely just created the webhook and none of the triggers have happened yet). If the last request failed, you will see a red ❌ which you can hover over to see the error message.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7717434/126981792-d1a66613-43d9-4992-a8e2-fe692b68198e.png)\\n\\n[#](#avoid-looping)\\n Avoid Looping\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n**⚠️ Warning:** Any time you make a commit in response to a triggered stream webhook event, you are at risk of creating an infinite loop on both your handling code and your speckle server.

This has security implications too.\\n*   database backups: again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability. Cloud providers can provide horizontal VM auto-scaling and Kubernetes can provide horizontal pod auto-scaling but these are not discussed in this guide.\\n*   monitoring: this setup does not describe integrations for telemetry, metrics, tracing, or logging. Nor does it describe alerting or response actions.\\n*   firewall and network hardening: running in production requires additional security hardening measures, particularly protecting the network from intrusion or data exfiltration.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\n[#](#prerequisites)\\n Prerequisites\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n*   \\\\[Required\\\\] A [DigitalOcean (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\\n     account.

We provided the cluster a name, but otherwise left configuration as per DigitalOcean\\'s recommended defaults. When prompted to select the node count and size, we selected four nodes. Each node has the default 2 vcpu and 4Gb (`s-2vcpu-4gb`). While this is a minimum, your usage may vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by deploying new nodes or larger sized machines in new node-pools. ![](/assets/img/01_select_node_size.07d7fdb8.png)\\n    \\n*   Configure other options for your Kubernetes cluster and click the `Create Cluster` button. After the cluster is created and initialized, you should see it in your list of kubernetes clusters: ![](/assets/img/02_kubernetes_clusters.21c632ca.png)\\n    \\n*   To log into the cluster, follow the getting started guide on the DigitalOcean dashboard for your cluster. We recommend the automated option of updating your local Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) using the [DigitalOcean client, `doctl` (opens new window)](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)\\n    . ![](/assets/img/03_get_kubeconfig.44d3076f.png)\\n    \\n*   After downloading the kubernetes config, you can verify that your kubernetes client has the cluster configuration by running the following command. A list of kubernetes clusters will be printed, your cluster context should have the prefix `do-`. Make a note of the name, you will use this in place of `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` in most of the following steps of this guide.\\n    \\n\\n    kubectl config get-contexts\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/04_show_contexts.5ec3c519.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl by running the following command to show the nodes you have provisioned.

Go to the [new Database creation page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases/new)\\n    . Firstly, select the same region and VPC as you used when deploying your Kubernetes cluster, and select Redis. Provide a name, and click `Create Database Cluster`. Again we used the default sizes, but your usage will vary and we recommend testing under your typical loads and adjusting by the database size as necessary. ![](/assets/img/06_redis_configuration.a2b13eaf.png)\\n    \\n*   From the overview, click on `Secure this database cluster by restricting access.`.

You can provide your own if you have an existing blob storage which is compatible with the [Amazon S3 API (opens new window)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html)\\n. Otherwise follow the following steps to create a new S3-compatible blob storage on DigitalOcean.\\n\\n*   Navigate to the [Create a Space page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/new)\\n    . Please select a region of your choice, we recommend the same region as you have deployed the cluster. We did not enable the CDN and we restricted the file listing for security purposes. Please provide a name for your Space, this has to be unique in the region so please use a different name than our example. Make a note of this name, this is the `bucket` value which we will require when configuring your deployment in [step 4](#step-4-configure-your-deployment)\\n    . Click on `Create Space`. ![](/assets/img/12_blob_storage_configuration.b77b8f17.png)\\n    \\n*   Once created, click on the `Settings` tab and copy the `Endpoint` value. ![](/assets/img/13_spaces_endpoint.1ed95325.png)\\n    \\n*   Now navigate to the [API page (opens new window)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)\\n     in DigitalOcean. Next to the `Spaces access keys` heading, click `Generate New Key`.

We can create a namespace in our Kubernetes cluster with the following command. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n\\n    kubectl create namespace speckle --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/15_create_namespace.a9e6faa4.png)\\n\\n*   Verify that the namespace was created by running the following command. You should see a list of namespaces, including `speckle`. The other existing namespaces were created by Kubernetes and are required for Kubernetes to run. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.\\n\\n    kubectl get namespace --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n![](/assets/img/16_get_namespaces.39b228b4.png)\\n\\n### [#](#step-3-b-create-secrets)\\n Step 3.b: Create Secrets\\n\\n*   To securely store the connection details of Speckle\\'s dependencies, we will create a secret in the Kubernetes Cluster in the `speckle` namespace. Replace all the items starting with `${YOUR_...}` with the appropriate value. `${YOUR_SECRET}` should be replaced with a value unique to this cluster, we recommend creating a random value of at least 10 characters long.\\n\\n    kubectl create secret generic server-vars \\\\\\n     --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\" \\\\\\n     --namespace speckle \\\\\\n     --from-literal=redis_url=\"${YOUR_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=postgres_url=\"${YOUR_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=s3_secret_key=\"${YOUR_SPACES_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=session_secret=\"${YOUR_SECRET}\" \\\\\\n     --from-literal=email_password=\"${YOUR_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD}\" # optional, only required if you wish to enable email invitations\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n\\n*   You can verify that your secret was created correctly by running the following command. Replace `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n    \\n        kubectl describe secret server-vars --namespace speckle --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\"\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/17_secrets.c124d433.png)\\n    \\n*   To view the contents of an individual secret, you can run the following replacing `redis_url` with the key you require and replacing `${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}` with the name of your cluster.:\\n    \\n\\n    kubectl get secret server-vars --context \"${YOUR_CLUSTER_CONTEXT_NAME}\" \\\\\\n      --namespace speckle \\\\\\n      --output jsonpath=\\'{.data.redis_url}\\' | base64 --decode\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n\\n*   Should you need to amend any values after creating the secret, use the following command. More information about working with secrets can be found on the [Kubernetes website (opens new window)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#editing-a-secret)\\n    .

This guide provides details on how to do that.\\n*   If you want to deploy the Server with your own modifications, you should build your own docker images. Please refer to our separate guide on [local development](./server-local-dev)\\n    .\\n\\n[#](#dependencies)\\n Dependencies\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe Speckle server needs these services available over the network:\\n\\n*   PostgreSQL (tested with v12 and v13)\\n*   Redis\\n*   Optional: S3-compatible Object Storage\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nPostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO are included in the following deployment instructions, so **you don\\'t need to install them manually**.\\n\\nYou can also install them manually or use a managed deployment from a cloud provider (Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc). Setting them up manually is out of scope of this article.\\n\\n[#](#run-in-a-virtual-machine)\\n Run in a Virtual Machine\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nThis setup is not recommended for use in production for a few reasons, namely:\\n\\n*   application level updates: we tend to move quite fast, and if things get busy, blink twice and you’re on an outdated server. this has security implications too.\\n*   guaranteed uptime: from our experience, vm’s tend to restart now and then (they need updates and reboots too), which results in downtime.\\n*   database backups - again this is up to you mostly on what’s your risk appetite when it comes to dealing with live data. We’re a bit more on the paranoid side, so we’ve set up replication, failover nodes and PITR.\\n*   end-to-end encryption: possibly less of daily concern - we’re offering from encryption at rest, to https security (SSL/TLS certs & renewal) - so whenever data travels between a client and the db it’s always encrypted, inc. inside the datacenter itself.\\n*   automatic scalability: for example, the preview service can be quite a monster; that setup can eat up all a vm’s resources, and starve other processes causing general system wide instability.\\n\\nIf you need help deploying a production server, [we can help (opens new window)](https://speckle.systems/getstarted/)\\n!\\n\\nThis is the easiest way to get the Server running.\\n\\nAs prerequisites, you only need a Linux VM with at least 4 GB of RAM and have [Docker (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script)\\n and [Docker Compose (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)\\n installed.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-create-a-directory-for-this-deployment-on-the-system)\\n Step 1: Create a Directory for this Deployment on the System\\n\\n    mkdir /opt/speckle/\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n\\n### [#](#step-2-copy-and-paste-this-into-a-file-named-docker-compose-yml-in-your-directory)\\n Step 2: Copy and paste this into a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your directory\\n\\n    version: \"2.3\"\\n    name: \"speckle-server\"\\n    \\n    services:\\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server dependencies\\n      #######\\n      postgres:\\n        image: \"postgres:14.5-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          POSTGRES_DB: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_USER: speckle\\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: speckle\\n        volumes:\\n          - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/\\n        healthcheck:\\n          # the -U user has to match the POSTGRES_USER value\\n          test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"pg_isready -U speckle\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      redis:\\n        image: \"redis:7-alpine\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - redis-data:/data\\n        ports:\\n          - \"127.0.0.1:6379:6379\"\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"--raw\", \"incr\", \"ping\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 30\\n    \\n      minio:\\n        image: \"minio/minio\"\\n        command: server /data --console-address \":9001\"\\n        restart: always\\n        volumes:\\n          - minio-data:/data\\n        healthcheck:\\n          test: [\"CMD\", \"mc\", \"ready\", \"local\"]\\n          interval: 5s\\n          timeout: 5s\\n          retries: 5\\n    \\n      ####\\n      # Speckle Server\\n      #######\\n      speckle-ingress:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-docker-compose-ingress:2\\n        restart: always\\n        ports:\\n          - \"0.0.0.0:80:8080\"\\n        environment:\\n          FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_MB: \"100\"\\n          NGINX_ENVSUBST_OUTPUT_DIR: \"/etc/nginx\"\\n    \\n      speckle-frontend-2:\\n        image: speckle/speckle-frontend-2:2\\n        restart: always\\n        environment:\\n          NUXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_NAME: \"local\"\\n          # TODO: Change NUXT_PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN to the URL of the speckle server, as accessed from the network.

You can find instructions on how to do that [here](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n.\\n\\nTo update Speckle:\\n\\n1.  connect to the virtual machine running the Speckle server instance\\n2.  navigate to the folder, where the Speckle server docker-compose file is located\\n3.  run `docker compose down` (this will take the server offline)\\n4.  review the latest changes in this guide against your `docker-compose.yml` file, and amend as necessary.\\n5.  run `docker compose pull` (this will retrieve the latest images)\\n6.  run `docker compose up -d` (this starts the server stack, and runs it in the background)\\n\\nYour server instance should be back online and updated.\\n\\n[#](#run-your-speckle-server-fork)\\n Run Your Speckle-Server Fork\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you made some changes to the server and want to run those instead of the official releases, we created some useful docker-compose.yml files to help with that.\\n\\n### [#](#step-1-set-up-dependencies)\\n Step 1: Set up Dependencies\\n\\nTIP\\n\\nIf you set up PostgreSQL, Redis and S3-compatible service outside of this VM (for example a managed deployment from a cloud provider), you can skip this step, but remember to set up the correct environment variables later\\n\\nTo get the PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO dependencies up and running in the VM, our git repo contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-deps.yml)\\n for running these dependencies locally in docker containers.\\n\\nIt also includes `PGAdmin` and `redis-insight` to be able to explore the raw data. If you don\\'t need them, you can safely remove those entries from the `docker-compose-deps.yml` file.\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _PostgreSQL v13_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:5432` with default credentials `speckle`:`speckle` and a database named `speckle`.\\n*   _Redis v6_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:6379`\\n*   _PGAdmin4_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:16543` with default credentials `admin@localhost` : `admin`\\n*   _Redis Insight_, listening only on `127.0.0.1:8001`\\n*   _MinIO_, listening on `127.0.0.1:9000` with the API endpoint and on `127.0.0.1:9001` with the Web Management Interface (default credentials used: `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`)\\n\\nAll of the above containers listen on the local loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`) and are NOT accessible from the local network (for security, since they use default credentials)\\n\\nTo use PGAdmin, after login you can configure a server connection to the host `postgres` (user `speckle`, password `speckle`, database `speckle`)\\n\\nTo use Redis Insight, you can configure it to connect to the hostname `redis` (port `6379`)\\n\\nDocker Compose creates named docker volumes for storing data for each of the containers, so data is persisted. You can view existing docker volumes with `docker volume ls` and delete a volume and existing data with `docker volume rm [volume_name]`\\n\\n### [#](#step-2-build-and-run-your-code)\\n Step 2: Build and Run Your Code\\n\\nThe git repository contains [a docker compose file (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/blob/main/docker-compose-speckle.yml)\\n for building and running the Speckle server frontend and backend in docker containers.\\n\\nTo use it, first edit the variables in the `docker-compose-speckle.yml` file to reflect your environment. Then, you can start them with:\\n\\n    cd [PATH_TO_SPECKLE-SERVER_REPOSITORY]\\n    docker compose -f docker-compose-speckle.yml up --build -d\\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n\\n(You can safely ignore the warnings about the _orphan containers_)\\n\\nThis will run the following containers, and will automatically launch them at system startup:\\n\\n*   _docker-compose-ingress_, an nginx container that routes traffic to either speckle-frontend-2 or speckle-server as required. This is exposed on port 80 in the VM network.\\n*   _speckle-frontend-2_, the frontend Vue app. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _speckle-server_, the `server` component. It doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _preview-service_, the component that generates stream previews. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _webhook-service_, the component that calls webhooks. Doesn\\'t expose any port outside of the internal docker network.\\n*   _fileimport-service_, the component that imports uploaded files.

This is a high efficiency getting started step list.\\n\\n[#](#supported-platforms)\\n Supported Platforms\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nSpeckle server has been developed on Linux, Windows WSL2, and MacOS. It _does not_ work on Windows without WSL2.\\n\\nOn MacOS devices with Apple based chips (M2, M3 etc.) it is possible to run the server as described below, but building and running Dockerfiles takes a lot of time (due to emulation of an x86 platform).\\n\\n### [#](#steps)\\n Steps\\n\\n1.  `git clone git@github.com:specklesystems/speckle-server.git` or, alternatively `git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git`\\n2.  `cd speckle-server`\\n3.  `corepack enable`\\n4.  `yarn`\\n5.  `yarn build`\\n6.  `yarn dev:docker:up`\\n7.  `cp packages/server/.env-example packages/server/.env`\\n8.  `cp packages/server/.env.test-example packages/server/.env.test`\\n9.  `cp packages/frontend-2/.env.example packages/frontend-2/.env`\\n10.  `cp packages/dui3/.env.example packages/dui3/.env`\\n11.  `yarn dev`\\n\\nWait for the frontend to build, and voila, you have a fully functional Speckle Server running at [http://localhost:3000 (opens new window)](http://localhost:3000)\\n.\\n\\nTo run a specific part of the Speckle server stack, go to the [components](#components)\\n section\\n\\n[#](#details)\\n Details\\n----------------------\\n\\nLet's step back and see what we did.\\n\\n1.  To clone the repo git with [ssh key (opens new window)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\\n     auth was used. You can use https based auth too, and can also gather some bonus points by using the `gh-cli` 😄\\n2.  We change into the cloned repository directory.\\n3.  Nodejs versions ^16 now come with a package manager manager bundled named `corepack`. It enables us to use yarn without actually installing anything.\\n4.  The monorepo is managed by [yarn workspaces (opens new window)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)\\n    . This way the package manager handles dependencies of the monorepo and the proper connections between the different packages. Running `yarn` a shorthand for `yarn install` bootstraps the repo.\\n5.  Some of the local packages (viewer, object loader) has to be built the first time so that all packages are linked properly. This can be done easily with a yarn script, where the yarn command will execute the given build script in all packages where it exists. So running `yarn build` triggers all available build commands.\\n6.  In this step, all the required services are started via docker compose. The `docker-compose-deps.yml` file contains a sensible default setup of all the required non Speckle developed services. This config by no means meant to be used in production. If you are not running these dependencies via docker compose, please make sure, that their configuration options are in line with either the compose file or the individual package configurations.\\n7.  In this step the provided example file is copied to a `.env` file with keeping the default values. Here again we are providing a set of sensible defaults that work out of the box if you follow this guide, but do make sure to reflect any changes you make in you environment.\\n8.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied when running tests or running the server in test mode\\n9.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to the new frontend\\n10.  Similarly to the last step, we're providing sensible defaults for env variables that are applied to dui3\\n11.  Just like above, we use yarn to run the `dev` script in each package. This is probably not the most efficient way, since it starts more packages in development mode, than needed, but its the easiest command that gets a server up and running. When developing, you probably want to run each component separately. A good enough setup might be to just run the server and the preferred frontend (run `yarn dev` only in those individual package directories).\\n\\nWhen running `yarn dev` for all packages you might see errors relating to `@speckle/shared` being missing, but this is only temporarily because `@speckle/shared` is also being re-built at that point in time. Once its finished building all of the other packages should pick up on it and work fine. You might also see GraphQL Codegen errors, which also are temporary, because they rely on the speckle server being up and running.\\n\\nIMPORTANT\\n\\nDon't forget to set up the variables in the `.env` & `.env.test` files according to your deployment\\n\\n[#](#components)\\n Components\\n----------------------------\\n\\nTo run a barebones Speckle Server, you need to run:\\n\\n*   the `frontend-2` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/frontend-2)\\n    )\\n*   the `server` package (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/server)\\n    )\\n\\nOptionally, to enable extra functionality, microservices should be run separately. For more information, check their `README.md` file in the git repository:\\n\\n*   the `preview-service` package generates preview images for streams (see [the readme.md file in the git repo (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/tree/main/packages/preview-service)\\n    )\\n*   the `webhook-service` package is responsible with calling the configured webhooks\\n*   the `fileimport-service` package parses and imports uploaded files into Speckle.\\n\\nDetailed instructions for running them locally are kept up to date in their respective `readme.md` files.\\n\\nIn this deployment type, the frontend Vue app will listen by default on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 8080`, but will have no knowledge about the `server` component, and thus **should not be accessed directly**.\\n\\nThe server component will listen on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 3000`, and will proxy the frontend requests to the frontend component (as configured in .env file).\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/server-local-dev.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 4/8/2024, 8:34:04 AM\\n\\n← [Deploying a Server - Docker Compose](/dev/server-manualsetup.html) [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)\",\n",

If installed with Speckle\\'s manual installation, by default the value of these are all `speckle`.\\n5.  (optional) For some databases, but not the default database provided by Speckle, you may also have to provide a Certificate.\\n    \\n    1.  Copy this certificate into the pgadmin container with `docker cp ./local/path/to/my/certificate.crt speckle-server-pgadmin-1:/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/` (assuming the default pgadmin user is `admin@localhost.com` and `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` is the name of the pgAdmin container.)\\n    2.

Expand `docker-compose` and `databases` to select your database. The default database name for Speckle is `speckle`.\\n    \\n2.  Once you have found the database in pgAdmin, right-click the database name and select `backup`.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/04_pgadmin_backup.47b980b4.png)\\n    \\n3.

This will generate a backup that is stored in the container\\'s volume.\\n    \\n6.  Once the backup is prepared, we now need to save the file to your local machine.\\n    \\n    *   If a `Click to open file location` button is displayed (this may depend on the version of pgAdmin running), click on it and download the backup to your machine.\\n        \\n    *   If a button is not displayed, you can copy the file from the container to your machine by user docker. Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n        \\n            docker cp speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/BACKUP_FILE_NAME\\' .\\n            \\n        \\n        1  \\n        \\n    *   If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake further steps to move the file from the host machine to either your local machine or storage location of your choice. DigitalOcean [suggest using `scp` (opens new window)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-copy-files-from-one-server-to-another-droplet)\\n        .\\n        \\n7.  We recommend testing the integrity of the backup at this time. One way of doing this is to install speckle-server on another machine (or modify the name and ports in the file and install a second locally), then upload the backup per the below instructions using pgAdmin. Use pgAdmin or Speckle to check that the information is present.\\n    \\n8.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\n### [#](#backing-up-a-docker-volume-optional)\\n Backing up a Docker Volume (Optional)\\n\\nAs well as creating a Postgres backup, we also recommend a full Docker volume backup. The Docker volume backup can only be used with the current version of Postgres, so is more limited than the Postgres backup created via pgAdmin (the latter allows us to move data between different versions of Postgres, which is useful when upgrading). Generating an additional backup from the Docker volume provides us with additional confidence that we can recover to a previous good working state.\\n\\n1.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  Follow the instructions on backing up a Docker Volume in [Docker\\'s Documentation (opens new window)](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)\\n    \\n3.  Store the backup in a safe and secure location. You may wish to copy the backup to multiple secure locations to provide redundancy.\\n    \\n\\nIf you are not upgrading the Postgres database, you can stop at this step. The following instructions relate only to the event of a major version upgrade of Postgres.\\n\\n### [#](#preparing-postgres-for-an-upgrade)\\n Preparing Postgres for an upgrade\\n\\n1.  Determine the name of the Docker container that is running your Postgres database, and the version of Postgres.\\n    \\n        docker ps --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n2.  If successful, the above will print out something similar to the below. In our example the name is `speckle-server-postgres-1` and the image version `13-alpine`.\\n    \\n        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                      NAMES\\n        510e024a4700   postgres:13-alpine   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   2 hours ago   Up 2 hours   127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp   speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    2  \\n    \\n3.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step will cause Speckle, and any other application relying on the database, to stop working until the database is restored. You may wish to notify users of your Speckle server about the disruption to Speckle before proceeding with this and the following steps. Stop your Postgres database with the following command, replacing `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker stop speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Remove the container from docker, this detaches it from its volume and allows the volume to be deleted. Replace `speckle-server-postgres-1` with the name of your container.\\n    \\n        docker rm speckle-server-postgres-1\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Find the name of the Postgres database volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume ls --filter name=\\'postgres\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  During upgrades we recommend undertaking a Docker volume backup. This allows us to restore to the previous version if the upgrade was unsuccessful. See the instructions for undertaking a Docker volume backup in the section above.\\n    \\n7.  ⚠️ **CAUTION** This step is destructive and cannot be undone, please ensure that the backup is correct and saved securely before proceeding - see instructions above. Delete the volume storing your Postgres database, replacing `speckle-server_postgres-data` with the name of your Postgres volume.\\n    \\n        docker volume rm speckle-server_postgres-data\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n#### [#](#upgrading-postgres)\\n Upgrading Postgres\\n\\n1.  If you installed Postgres using Docker Compose, please log into the machine in which you installed it.\\n    \\n2.  Using `git`, clone the Speckle Server repository. More details instructions are available in GitHub\\'s documentation.\\n    \\n        git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.\\n    \\n        cd speckle-server\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n4.  Check out the version of Speckle Server you wish to deploy. For example, using `git` on the command line to checkout a tagged version - in this case Speckle Server version `2.9.0` (please change to the [latest released version (opens new window)](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server/releases)\\n    , or the version you wish to deploy):\\n    \\n        git checkout tags/2.9.0 -b main\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n5.  Deploy the docker-compose file with the updated Postgres version:\\n    \\n        docker compose -f ./docker-compose-deps.yml up --detach\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n6.  Verify everything is up and running by viewing the status of all containers:\\n    \\n        docker ps\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n\\n### [#](#restoring-your-data-to-postgres-from-pgadmin-backup)\\n Restoring your Data to Postgres from pgAdmin Backup\\n\\n1.  If connected via SSH to a DigitalOcean or other virtual or remote machine, you will have to undertake steps to move the file your local machine or storage location to the host machine (Droplet).

Replace `speckle-server-pgadmin-1` with the name of your pgAdmin container and `BACKUP_FILE_NAME` with the file name you provided in the pgAdmin dialog.\\n    \\n        docker cp BACKUP_FILE_NAME speckle-server-pgadmin-1:\\'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/\\'\\n        \\n    \\n    1  \\n    \\n3.  Connect to pgAdmin using the instructions above.\\n    \\n4.  Connect pgAdmin to the server using the instructions above.\\n    \\n5.  Right-click `databases` from the browser window, and click `create`. The name of the database should be `speckle`.\\n    \\n6.  Right-click the created database and click `restore`, selecting your previously stored backup. You will need to upload the backup you previously downloaded back into pgAdmin first.\\n    \\n    ![](/assets/img/06_pgadmin_restore.85bf2552.png)\\n    \\n7.  If you encounter errors at this point, it may be because pgAdmin considers the database to be a `maintenance database`. To workaround this issue please try the following:\\n    \\n    1.  Create another (maybe empty) database.\\n    2.  Disconnect from the Speckle database.\\n    3.  Edit server properties for other database.\\n    4.

They function like ordinary OAuth access tokens, and they enable a script, an app, or any other piece of code to **act on your behalf**.\\n\\nThis means that with a token, an app or script is able to:\\n\\n*   read any streams you have access to\\n*   create streams on your behalf\\n*   share those streams with other users\\n*   create commits against a stream you have write access to\\n*   read the profile (public information) of other users.\\n\\nSecurity advisory\\n\\nTreat any personal access tokens like a password: do not post them anywhere where they could be accessed by others (e.g., public repos).\\n\\n[#](#creating-a-token)\\n Creating a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, you need to login and go to your profile (/profile). Just under \"Your Apps\" section, you will see a list of all the personal access tokens that you have created so far, and you\\'ll be able to create a new one.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens1.dfd285b0.png)\\n\\nTo create a new token, click on the new token button. A dialog will appear that will ask you for some basic details about it.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens2.ad8a0c88.png)\\n\\nThe token name should be something that you can remember. The token scopes define what actions can be taken with that specific token.\\n\\nToken Scopes\\n\\nIt\\'s good practice to limit the scopes to minimum required ones. For example, if you\\'re creating a script or app that just **reads** from streams, and doesn\\'t need to create new ones, or edit existing ones, just assign it the `streams:read` scope.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens3.09032568.png)\\n\\nOnce your token is created, the dialog will display it. This is the first and last time you will be able to see the full token and you should store it somewhere safe now.\\n\\n![](/assets/img/tokens4.2dbb6491.png)\\n\\n[#](#using-a-token)\\n Using a Token\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you have a token, you usually will need to pass it as an authorization header in any server bound requests.\\n\\nFor example, here is a simple request to get the total count of your streams using javascript:\\n\\n    let res = await fetch(\\'/graphql\\', {\\n      method: \\'POST\\',\\n      headers: {\\n        Authorization: \\'Bearer \\' + token, // <- Passing in the token!\\n        \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'\\n      },\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ user { id streams { totalCount } } }` })\\n    })\\n    \\n    \\n\\n1  \\n2  \\n3  \\n4  \\n5  \\n6  \\n7  \\n8  \\n9  \\n\\nNote that the token needs to be prefixed with the word `Bearer`; a full token would look like `Bearer xxx`.\\n\\n[#](#revoking-a-token)\\n Revoking a Token\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you\\'re no longer using a token, or you think it may be compromised (did you commit it by accident to a public github repo?), you can revoke a token. It will be completely disabled and no more actions will be able to be taken with it.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nAs soon as possible afterwards, make sure any scripts or apps using that token did not break!\\n\\n[Edit this page](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-docs/edit/main/dev/tokens.md)\\n (opens new window)\\n\\nLast Updated: 9/6/2022, 12:01:02 PM\\n\\n← [Database backup, upgrade, and restore](/dev/server-database-migration.html) [Creating Your Own App](/dev/apps.html)\\n →\\n\\nClose\\n\\nLog in\\n\\n[Coded by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)',\n",
